clip_1 | Just 50 years ago,
clip_2 | we finally ventured to the moon.
clip_3 | For the very first time, we looked back at our own planet.
clip_4 | Since then, the human population has more than doubled.
clip_5 | This series will celebrate the natural wonders that remain
clip_6 | and reveal what we must preserve
clip_7 | to ensure people and nature thrive.
clip_8 | The Earth still has sanctuaries,
clip_9 | and, on occasion, they hold spectacular gatherings of wildlife.
clip_10 | They provide vital space, but they're disappearing fast.
clip_11 | A fifth of the land on our planet is covered by desert.
clip_12 | The driest of all is the Atacama in South America.
clip_13 | There are places here where rain has never been recorded.
clip_14 | Deserts may appear to be barren and empty,
clip_15 | but they are of crucial importance to life.
clip_16 | For those that can overcome their challenges,
clip_17 | they provide a vital refuge.
clip_18 | Socotran cormorants,
clip_19 | emerging from a dust storm in the Arabian desert.
clip_20 | It is the very emptiness of this landscape that has brought them here,
clip_21 | and they have come in immense numbers.
clip_22 | Fifty thousand of them.
clip_23 | A quarter of the total population.
clip_24 | They have come because here they can breed...
clip_25 | undisturbed.
clip_26 | But nesting in a desert is difficult.
clip_27 | Temperatures can reach 40 degrees Celsius.
clip_28 | Yet, both the adults and their white chicks
clip_29 | are ready for this challenge.
clip_30 | They cool themselves by panting.
clip_31 | Any adult that appears to have food in its crop is mobbed.
clip_32 | An adult will only give food to its own chick,
clip_33 | which must be here somewhere.
clip_34 | The chicks chase an adult out into the desert.
clip_35 | No luck.
clip_36 | Now, they must get back quickly to the safety of the colony.
clip_37 | This desert provides the cormorants
clip_38 | with more than just a secure refuge.
clip_39 | Every morning, a mass movement begins.
clip_40 | It's the rush hour.
clip_41 | A shallow arm of the sea, right beside the colony,
clip_42 | is full of food.
clip_43 | This richness comes from the desert itself.
clip_44 | Dust, blown from the land,
clip_45 | contains nutrients that fertilize the surrounding waters.
clip_46 | So, it is the desert itself that enriches the sea.
clip_47 | In Oman, during the summer monsoon, fogs roll in from the sea,
clip_48 | billowing over the Dhofar mountains.
clip_49 | The mists bring just enough moisture to sustain a little vegetation...
clip_50 | and this sparse greenery becomes a focus for life.
clip_51 | Ibex must cross the near vertical cliffs to reach one of the few springs.
clip_52 | But they're nervous...
clip_53 | and with good reason.
clip_54 | An Arabian leopard,
clip_55 | one of less than 200 that survive in the wild.
clip_56 | This male's territory
clip_57 | extends over 350 square kilometers of high mountains and deep wadis.
clip_58 | The southern edge of the Arabian Peninsula
clip_59 | is one of the few places left where there is enough prey
clip_60 | to sustain a population of these leopards.
clip_61 | But even so, there are probably less than 60 individuals
clip_62 | in over 15,000 square kilometers.
clip_63 | These leopards have always been rare,
clip_64 | but now conflict with people
clip_65 | is causing their numbers to decline still further.
clip_66 | Few leopards are left,
clip_67 | so what our hidden cameras now capture verges on the miraculous.
clip_68 | A female leopard,
clip_69 | and she is tracking a male.
clip_70 | Such meetings are becoming increasingly rare.
clip_71 | This briefest of unions
clip_72 | may ensure the short-term future for these leopards.
clip_73 | But in the longer term,
clip_74 | their fate will depend on their territory being protected.
clip_75 | To the north of the Dhofar mountains
clip_76 | lies a place of almost unimaginable emptiness.
clip_77 | The Rub' al Khali,
clip_78 | the Empty Quarter.
clip_79 | The very name of the place
clip_80 | resonates with the romance of these desert lands.
clip_81 | This is the largest sand sea in the world.
clip_82 | There are parts where human beings never venture.
clip_83 | Only the greatest desert specialists can survive here.
clip_84 | Arabian oryx.
clip_85 | Their ranges are vast,
clip_86 | extending for over 3,000 square kilometers.
clip_87 | This is one of their last refuges.
clip_88 | Once hunted close to extinction,
clip_89 | they have now reclaimed their ancestral territory.
clip_90 | With the help of conservationists, they have returned home.
clip_91 | But reintroduction cannot save all desert animals.
clip_92 | Desert elephants.
clip_93 | Less than 150 survive, here in Namibia.
clip_94 | This oldest of deserts is scarred by dry riverbeds,
clip_95 | carved by water that flows for only one or two days in a year.
clip_96 | An adult elephant
clip_97 | must find up to 200 kilos of food each and every day if it's not to starve.
clip_98 | So, for these last survivors, life is an endless trek.
clip_99 | The herd is guided by a single old female, the matriarch.
clip_100 | She is leading her family
clip_101 | to a special place where food should be available
clip_102 | even in a drought.
clip_103 | She learned of its existence from her mother,
clip_104 | many years ago.
clip_105 | Now, she's teaching her own calf how to get there.
clip_106 | The elephants are not alone in their search for food.
clip_107 | Desert lions.
clip_108 | They are just as rare as the elephants.
clip_109 | The calf is protected by its mother.
clip_110 | So the lions let them pass.
clip_111 | Distant trees are a sign of water.
clip_112 | The riverbed is dry.
clip_113 | The ana trees, however, are still green.
clip_114 | But there is a problem.
clip_115 | At this time of year,
clip_116 | seedpods from the ana trees usually litter the ground.
clip_117 | Rich food for elephants.
clip_118 | But this year, the crop has failed.
clip_119 | The matriarch has led her herd here for nothing.
clip_120 | Even the trees' leafy branches are out of their reach.
clip_121 | The family has no option but to move on.
clip_122 | A bull, standing nearly four meters tall.
clip_123 | He can reach into the canopy,
clip_124 | and he could be the solution to their problem.
clip_125 | The old female has known him all her life and turned to him for help before.
clip_126 | Elephants can only survive here
clip_127 | because of knowledge passed down over generations.
clip_128 | But less than 20 matriarchs still survive,
clip_129 | and if their knowledge is lost,
clip_130 | elephants may no longer be able to live here.
clip_131 | Deserts cannot support large numbers of animals the year round,
clip_132 | and even those specially adapted to these conditions
clip_133 | can only survive in small numbers.
clip_134 | But on very special occasions,
clip_135 | deserts are transformed.
clip_136 | Once in a decade,
clip_137 | there may be a cloudburst.
clip_138 | A single one can turn the desert green.
clip_139 | In southern California,
clip_140 | the change is visible from space.
clip_141 | Hundreds of square kilometers suddenly bloom.
clip_142 | If such transformations become regular,
clip_143 | a new habitat may develop.
clip_144 | Grasslands.
clip_145 | One of our planet's most productive landscapes.
clip_146 | They support the greatest aggregations of large animals on Earth.
clip_147 | The Serengeti sustains herds of over a million wildebeest.
clip_148 | They follow the rains to crop the newly sprung grass.
clip_149 | These vast herds attract predators.
clip_150 | Five male cheetahs.
clip_151 | One of the largest coalitions ever observed.
clip_152 | They dominate a territory of 450 square kilometers.
clip_153 | They patrol it together,
clip_154 | and that attracts attention.
clip_155 | A change of strategy is needed
clip_156 | if they're to hunt successfully.
clip_157 | They need cover.
clip_158 | An adult wildebeest is a formidable opponent.
clip_159 | Four of the cheetahs start the stalk,
clip_160 | walking directly towards the prey.
clip_161 | The fifth creeps around the side.
clip_162 | They need to get really close before making their final sprint.
clip_163 | They're nearly there.
clip_164 | All five break cover,
clip_165 | each cat chasing a different target.
clip_166 | It's chaos.
clip_167 | A single cheetah is not strong enough to defend its prize.
clip_168 | They must work together.
clip_169 | These dramas only continue because the Serengeti is protected,
clip_170 | and has been for over 65 years.
clip_171 | But the Serengeti is an exception.
clip_172 | Across the planet, space for grasslands has been steadily disappearing.
clip_173 | A hundred and eighty years ago, herds of bison, millions strong,
clip_174 | grazed the Great Plains of North America.
clip_175 | They roamed across a prairie a hundred times larger than the Serengeti.
clip_176 | This was the true wild west.
clip_177 | Every summer, the males roared their challenges
clip_178 | and fought for possession of the females.
clip_179 | As the rut intensified, the fights became more brutal.
clip_180 | Today, however, most of the prairie is silent.
clip_181 | Humans slaughtered the great herds.
clip_182 | Less than 30,000 wild bison remain,
clip_183 | and 90 percent of the prairie has been lost,
clip_184 | most of it to agriculture.
clip_185 | What we eat, and how we produce it,
clip_186 | will determine the future of our planet's grasslands.
clip_187 | Our past could show us how we can feed ourselves
clip_188 | and still leave room for nature.
clip_189 | The ancient hay meadows of Hungary, still farmed in the traditional way,
clip_190 | provide habitats of extraordinary richness.
clip_191 | Butterflies are abundant.
clip_192 | One species has an almost unbelievably complex life cycle.
clip_193 | The Alcon blue.
clip_194 | Each female must mate and lay eggs on just one species of plant,
clip_195 | the marsh gentian.
clip_196 | The eggs soon hatch into caterpillars.
clip_197 | High up on the plants, they're safe from predators below.
clip_198 | But then, the caterpillars do something seemingly suicidal.
clip_199 | They abseil down on threads of silk to the ground below...
clip_200 | and into danger.
clip_201 | They have no defense against the marauding ants,
clip_202 | which carry them off.
clip_203 | But this is exactly what the caterpillars need to happen.
clip_204 | They're producing a scent like that emitted by an ant larva.
clip_205 | The ants respond by taking them back to their nest.
clip_206 | There, they deposit them in the colony's brood chamber.
clip_207 | The purple-colored caterpillars, lying among the ants' own white larvae,
clip_208 | give off just the right signals.
clip_209 | And the nurse ants rush to feed them.
clip_210 | But there is more.
clip_211 | The caterpillars now start to mimic the sounds made by the queen ant,
clip_212 | and, as a result, the ants treat them like royalty.
clip_213 | If food gets short,
clip_214 | the ants will even feed the caterpillars instead of their own young.
clip_215 | They give them such quantities of food that the caterpillars grow hugely.
clip_216 | And there, underground, the caterpillars feed and grow for nearly two years.
clip_217 | Until, one day, there is nothing for the ants to feed.
clip_218 | The caterpillars have pupated.
clip_219 | But a few weeks later,
clip_220 | out crawls an Alcon blue butterfly.
clip_221 | Now, they begin to leave the nest
clip_222 | that has been their home for the last 23 months.
clip_223 | The young adult makes its way out of the nest
clip_224 | and clambers up a grass stem.
clip_225 | Its wings expand as it prepares to fly off and find a mate.
clip_226 | This complex life may be laborsaving for the butterfly,
clip_227 | but it's risky.
clip_228 | If anything happened to the ants or to the gentian,
clip_229 | the Alcon blue would become extinct.
clip_230 | Only tiny fragments of these ancient meadows
clip_231 | are left in Europe.
clip_232 | But beyond them to the east,
clip_233 | once stretched grasslands that extended for a fifth of the way around the world,
clip_234 | from Romania to China.
clip_235 | Here, there are places where, for mile after endless mile,
clip_236 | there are no roads or fences.
clip_237 | Here, where there are no trees, eagles nest on the ground.
clip_238 | Once, these eagles would have preyed on antelope that numbered in millions.
clip_239 | And some are still here.
clip_240 | These are saiga, antelope that live nowhere else in the world.
clip_241 | Their extraordinary noses are specially adapted
clip_242 | to filter out the dust kicked up by the immense herds
clip_243 | that once lived here.
clip_244 | Now, they're critically endangered.
clip_245 | Poaching and the loss of habitat have had a devastating impact on them.
clip_246 | But conservation efforts have recently started to make a difference.
clip_247 | There is still hope for these extraordinary plains dwellers.
clip_248 | And the proof of this can be found further east, in Mongolia,
clip_249 | where the grasslands still remain largely intact.
clip_250 | These are Przewalski’s horses.
clip_251 | Fifty years ago, they were extinct in the wild,
clip_252 | but a few adults survived in captivity.
clip_253 | Careful breeding from 12 of them increased their numbers
clip_254 | until there were sufficient to release on the plains.
clip_255 | These are their descendants.
clip_256 | A stallion protects each harem.
clip_257 | They must be vigilant, and they race to defend their herd...
clip_258 | or chase off bachelors trying to lure away a mare.
clip_259 | With their numbers now topping 300,
clip_260 | the future for these wild horses looks more secure.
clip_261 | Their recovery was only possible
clip_262 | because the vast Mongolian steppe still remains largely untouched.
clip_263 | These grasses are some of the tallest to be found anywhere on our planet.
clip_264 | They're so tall they can conceal elephants.
clip_265 | They make the giants that live among them seem small.
clip_266 | A last hiding place
clip_267 | for the highly endangered greater one-horned rhino.
clip_268 | This is India,
clip_269 | one of the most populous countries on Earth.
clip_270 | Yet here there is a great determination to protect these crucial grasslands.
clip_271 | What must it be like
clip_272 | to live in this dense, claustrophobic world?
clip_273 | Just moving about could mean walking into danger.
clip_274 | The grasses conceal tigers.
clip_275 | Stripes and shadows blend.
clip_276 | Long grass may hide a tigress from her prey,
clip_277 | but it also hides the prey from her.
clip_278 | She must get within 20 meters of it.
clip_279 | And she must always know exactly where the prey are hidden.
clip_280 | She may have lost them.
clip_281 | She risks a look.
clip_282 | Every deer around now knows exactly where the tiger is.
clip_283 | Others have heard the signal that announced her failure.
clip_284 | Her cubs.
clip_285 | She had left them hidden in the grass.
clip_286 | In the last hundred years,
clip_287 | the number of wild tigers has declined by over 95 percent.
clip_288 | But here in India,
clip_289 | despite the enormous pressure from poaching,
clip_290 | and a growing human population,
clip_291 | tiger numbers are actually increasing.
clip_292 | Protect the precious space that grasslands and deserts provide,
clip_293 | and the animals will bounce back.

clip_295 | to discover what we need to do now to protect wild grasslands.
