clip_1 | Just 50 years ago,
clip_2 | we finally ventured to the moon.
clip_3 | For the very first time, we looked back at our own planet.
clip_4 | Since then, the human population has more than doubled.
clip_5 | This series will celebrate the natural wonders that remain,
clip_6 | and reveal what we must preserve
clip_7 | to ensure people and nature thrive.
clip_8 | The polar regions of our planet may seem beyond the reach of most of us,
clip_9 | but they are not beyond our influence.
clip_10 | We, unintentionally, are changing these frozen worlds,
clip_11 | and these changes will not just affect the poles
clip_12 | but the whole planet.
clip_13 | Antarctica.
clip_14 | The southern end of our planet, and the coldest place on Earth.
clip_15 | It has been frozen for 30 million years.
clip_16 | In its center, the covering of ice is over four kilometers thick.
clip_17 | Entire mountain ranges are buried beneath it.
clip_18 | Here, it is so cold that each winter
clip_19 | 19 million square kilometers of ocean freezes,
clip_20 | more than doubling the size of the ice cap.
clip_21 | But when, in spring, the sea ice melts,
clip_22 | life returns once again to the continent's shores.
clip_23 | The peninsula that stretches north towards South America
clip_24 | is the first part of it to be released from winter's grip.
clip_25 | As the sea ice breaks up,
clip_26 | life returns.
clip_27 | There is a greater variety of living creatures here
clip_28 | than anywhere else in Antarctica.
clip_29 | Gentoo penguins spend most of their lives at sea,
clip_30 | but now, in spring, they have to come ashore to breed.
clip_31 | They're the fastest of all penguins in water,
clip_32 | but on land, life takes on a slower pace.
clip_33 | It's an uphill struggle to reach their nesting grounds...
clip_34 | ...but penguins never give up.
clip_35 | The paths they follow, carved by thousands of tiny footsteps,
clip_36 | lead to Antarctica's rarest commodity.
clip_37 | Bare rock.
clip_38 | Less than one percent of Antarctica is ice-free,
clip_39 | and these rocky patches
clip_40 | are the only places where gentoos can lay their eggs.
clip_41 | It's been a 30-minute struggle,
clip_42 | but he's almost at the top, where his mate is waiting for him.
clip_43 | He presents her with a stone,
clip_44 | a gift to improve the nest and so win her favor.
clip_45 | He's back just in time.
clip_46 | There's another mouth to feed.
clip_47 | Gentoo penguins used to be rare in this part of Antarctica,
clip_48 | but now, as temperatures rise, their numbers here are increasing.
clip_49 | Sea ice may appear to be flat and lifeless,
clip_50 | but beneath it there is another world.
clip_51 | As the ice melts, the light filters through,
clip_52 | and algae, that have been trapped within the ice all winter, flourish.
clip_53 | This upside-down world
clip_54 | is the polar equivalent of the great grasslands.
clip_55 | The ice is the soil upon which plant life grows,
clip_56 | and the herds of grazers soon arrive.
clip_57 | Antarctic krill.
clip_58 | Trillions of them swarm in the waters around Antarctica.
clip_59 | Protected by the ice above, they graze on algae whilst the sun shines.
clip_60 | But the good times don't last long.
clip_61 | Once all the ice has melted, the krill lose their protection,
clip_62 | and predators appear.
clip_63 | Penguins may have lost their ability to fly,
clip_64 | but they still form flocks, as so many birds do.
clip_65 | The longer they dive,
clip_66 | the longer it takes them to catch their breath.
clip_67 | Ruffling their feathers traps air, which makes their bodies more streamlined.
clip_68 | One last breath...
clip_69 | and the whole group dives down together.
clip_70 | The gentoos follow the krill down to depths of over 200 meters.
clip_71 | What a flock can catch in one dive,
clip_72 | a giant traps in a single mouthful.
clip_73 | Humpback whales from the tropics
clip_74 | have traveled over 8,000 kilometers to get here.
clip_75 | This one chooses to feed alone.
clip_76 | This technique, part lunge, part pounce,
clip_77 | only works when the krill are close to the surface.
clip_78 | As more humpbacks arrive, they begin to work in teams.
clip_79 | By lunging together,
clip_80 | the overspill from one huge mouth is not lost but collected by another.
clip_81 | Some humpbacks regularly work in an even more coordinated way.
clip_82 | They do so when krill has descended to some depth.
clip_83 | Once in position, they blast air from their blowholes.
clip_84 | Working together,
clip_85 | they create a curtain of bubbles around their prey.
clip_86 | As the spiraling net tightens, the krill are driven closer together,
clip_87 | and then the whales lunge upwards and collect them.
clip_88 | Almost all humpback whales in the southern hemisphere
clip_89 | come to the Antarctic to feed on krill.
clip_90 | Since the ban on commercial whaling, their numbers have recovered dramatically,
clip_91 | but their food supply is now under threat.
clip_92 | In the last 50 years,
clip_93 | with warming temperatures and disappearing sea ice,
clip_94 | krill stocks in this part of the Southern Ocean
clip_95 | have more than halved.
clip_96 | Other sea hunters come here seeking bigger prey than krill.
clip_97 | Antarctica's top predators.
clip_98 | Orca, killer whales.
clip_99 | Over half of the world's orca patrol these polar seas.
clip_100 | This particular pod specializes in hunting penguins.
clip_101 | They shift into stealth mode.
clip_102 | Hunting without making a sound, so that their prey won't hear them coming.
clip_103 | A penguin can outmaneuver a single killer whale,
clip_104 | but it can seldom escape a pod.
clip_105 | This hunt may seem cruel,
clip_106 | but important life skills are being passed down the generations.
clip_107 | From killer whales to krill,
clip_108 | all life here ultimately depends upon Antarctica's sea ice.
clip_109 | The seas that surround Antarctica are the roughest on our planet.
clip_110 | These churning waters draw up nutrients from the deep
clip_111 | and create vast, rich fishing grounds for nomads like the wandering albatross.
clip_112 | Beneath the waves, currents are flowing away from Antarctica,
clip_113 | transporting nutrients across the planet, fertilizing the oceans
clip_114 | and helping to regulate global temperatures.
clip_115 | The island of South Georgia.
clip_116 | It's far enough north
clip_117 | to be beyond the reach of the sea ice even in midwinter,
clip_118 | and many animals live here the year round.
clip_119 | This wandering albatross chick has been sitting on its nest all winter,
clip_120 | and is entirely dependent on its parents returning with food.
clip_121 | It may have to wait a few days between meals, or even a couple of weeks,
clip_122 | but at least it's not the only one who's waiting.
clip_123 | Albatross chicks need to spend a whole year growing
clip_124 | before they're ready to take their first flight.
clip_125 | And then they spend several years at sea before they return to land.
clip_126 | Coming in to land on three-meter wings takes some practice.
clip_127 | Albatross don't have reverse thrusters.
clip_128 | The chick is this female's first.
clip_129 | She's been raising it for six months, and has another six to go.
clip_130 | Her chick is smaller than it should be,
clip_131 | a sign that her mate has not been returning with food.
clip_132 | He may well have been one of the many that die,
clip_133 | entangled on longline fishing lines.
clip_134 | South Georgia is an ideal place for wanderers to raise their young,
clip_135 | but now fewer adults are returning here to nest,
clip_136 | and in recent years,
clip_137 | the breeding population has declined by 40 percent.
clip_138 | For now, waiting on its nest, the chick is safe.
clip_139 | There are no land predators here.
clip_140 | But the same cannot be said for South Georgia's seas.
clip_141 | Giant kelp flourishes in these ice-free waters.
clip_142 | The perfect place for an ambush.
clip_143 | Leopard seals overwinter here to escape Antarctica's frozen ocean.
clip_144 | They should have returned south by now,
clip_145 | but this year they've stayed longer.
clip_146 | And they've delayed their departure for good reason.
clip_147 | There are king penguins here.
clip_148 | Each is a substantial meal,
clip_149 | if you can catch it.
clip_150 | Returning to feed their chicks,
clip_151 | the kings have no choice but to run the gauntlet.
clip_152 | Kings rarely porpoise like this.
clip_153 | It uses more energy, but it's faster than traveling underwater.
clip_154 | It's hard to select a moving target in a panicking crowd,
clip_155 | but if there are stragglers, the odds change.
clip_156 | Razor-sharp teeth versus a stabbing beak.
clip_157 | It's stalemate.
clip_158 | Both are exhausted after the chase.
clip_159 | The hunter decides that the meal is not worth the fight.
clip_160 | For the penguin, it was too close for comfort,
clip_161 | but that was just the first hurdle in getting back to feed its chick.
clip_162 | It isn't going to be a walk in the park.
clip_163 | Luckily, penguin is not on their menu.
clip_164 | Still, it's best to let sleeping giants lie.
clip_165 | Elephant seal females don't take kindly
clip_166 | to being disturbed from their slumber,
clip_167 | but it's the four-tonne males you need to look out for.
clip_168 | They are fighting for access to the females.
clip_169 | Getting bulldozed under angry blubber is to be avoided at all costs.
clip_170 | An escape route.
clip_171 | Time to run for it.
clip_172 | At last, he's reached the nursery.
clip_173 | Now comes his final challenge.
clip_174 | Finding his chick in the crowd of half a million.
clip_175 | He calls...
clip_176 | ...and listens for a recognizable reply.
clip_177 | His chick could be another mile or two away,
clip_178 | at the back of the colony.
clip_179 | But that's the trouble with chicks.
clip_180 | They're never where you left them.
clip_181 | Astonishingly, in all this racket,
clip_182 | a parent and its chick can recognize each other's calls.
clip_183 | The things parents go through to deliver a meal.
clip_184 | If only they knew.
clip_185 | For such a small island,
clip_186 | South Georgia supports an extraordinary quantity of life.
clip_187 | All these creatures ultimately depend on the krill
clip_188 | that develops under the sea ice around the Antarctic peninsula.
clip_189 | With sea ice disappearing,
clip_190 | so South Georgia's future is far from certain.
clip_191 | At the other end of the planet, in the north,
clip_192 | the effects of climate change are being felt even more intensely.
clip_193 | The Arctic is not a continent surrounded by sea
clip_194 | but a frozen ocean ringed by land.
clip_195 | Here, in spring, the sea ice is still at its maximum extent.
clip_196 | It's a vast, firm hunting ground for the planet's largest land carnivore.
clip_197 | A male polar bear in search of his next meal
clip_198 | on the frozen fjords of Svalbard in the high Arctic.
clip_199 | He's looking for seals, which make up the bulk of his diet.
clip_200 | He must eat two-thirds of the food he needs for the whole year
clip_201 | before the ice melts and his hunting platform disappears.
clip_202 | The ringed seal mother had no choice but to leave her pup alone on the surface.
clip_203 | In the past, she would have built a den inside a ridge on the ice,
clip_204 | but now the sea freezes so late that the ice is flat,
clip_205 | and she had to leave her pup out in the open.
clip_206 | These changes in the ice may benefit the bears for now,
clip_207 | but in the long term,
clip_208 | a crash in their most important prey will follow.
clip_209 | This new, flatter ice makes life difficult for the bears, too.
clip_210 | There's nowhere for them to hide in order to creep up on a seal.
clip_211 | And for a mother with a young cub in tow, being stealthy isn't easy.
clip_212 | The cub doesn't yet appreciate the need for care
clip_213 | when sneaking up on a seal.
clip_214 | With fewer seals hiding in dens,
clip_215 | learning this pounding technique, once so useful,
clip_216 | is now almost pointless.
clip_217 | Still, at least he's discovered what a seal hole looks like..
clip_218 | His mother knows that overcast conditions are good for hunting,
clip_219 | and he knows when she's serious.
clip_220 | Adult seals make a much better meal.
clip_221 | Her cub carefully treads in her footsteps,
clip_222 | and takes care not to break her outline.
clip_223 | Neither must put a foot wrong.
clip_224 | They must move as one.
clip_225 | Most seal hunts end in failure.
clip_226 | The bears must keep searching.
clip_227 | Her cub wanders off,
clip_228 | and gets another chance.
clip_229 | A seal pup alone on the ice.
clip_230 | Now it's not stealth that is needed, but confidence.
clip_231 | There's nothing the mother can do,
clip_232 | except hope that the pup makes it back to her hole in time.
clip_233 | The inexperienced young hunter hesitates.
clip_234 | Its mother knows better.
clip_235 | Safe under the ice.
clip_236 | Polar bears are adaptable predators, but they rely on sea ice.
clip_237 | If that disappears, so will the bears.
clip_238 | Summer at the ice edge in the Canadian Arctic,
clip_239 | and the annual retreat of sea ice is well underway.
clip_240 | As it melts, nomads arrive.
clip_241 | Narwhal, the origin of the unicorn legend.
clip_242 | Their three-meter tusk is, in fact, no more than an overgrown canine tooth,
clip_243 | but its exact function, like so much about narwhals,
clip_244 | is still, in part, a mystery.
clip_245 | Each summer, narwhals travel to the same part of the Arctic,
clip_246 | and patiently wait at the ice edge for a crack to open up.
clip_247 | A lead in the ice, wide enough for them to swim along.
clip_248 | Eventually, a crack appears.
clip_249 | Their passage to sheltered, shallow bays.
clip_250 | Narwhals are extremely timid and rarely filmed underwater.
clip_251 | These ice whales eagerly travel down the leads as soon as they open
clip_252 | because they're safer from predators protected by the ice.
clip_253 | The leads may also give them access to new feeding grounds.
clip_254 | Sea ice is not just crucial
clip_255 | to the lives of those creatures that live around the poles.
clip_256 | It plays a vital role in determining the climate of the whole planet.
clip_257 | A white surface keeps the earth cool
clip_258 | by reflecting most of the sun's energy back into space.
clip_259 | A dark surface does the opposite,
clip_260 | absorbing over 90 percent of the sun's energy
clip_261 | and so warming the earth.
clip_262 | As the sea ice shrinks,
clip_263 | we're starting to lose one of our planet's protective white shields.
clip_264 | For thousands of years,
clip_265 | there's been a balance in the advance and retreat of the sea ice,
clip_266 | but that is no longer the case.
clip_267 | Today, during the summer months,
clip_268 | there is 40 percent less sea ice cover than there was in 1980.
clip_269 | The Arctic is warming twice as fast as anywhere else on our planet.
clip_270 | By 2040, the ocean here will be largely free of ice
clip_271 | during the summer months.
clip_272 | This loss of ice will inevitably have devastating consequences
clip_273 | for all those that still depend on it.
clip_274 | The far northeastern coast of Russia.
clip_275 | This is the largest gathering of walrus on the planet.
clip_276 | Over a hundred thousand have hauled out on one single beach.
clip_277 | They do so out of desperation, not out of choice.
clip_278 | Their natural home is out on the sea ice.
clip_279 | But the ice has retreated away to the north,
clip_280 | and this is the closest place to their feeding grounds,
clip_281 | where they can find rest.
clip_282 | This calf must stay close to its mother.
clip_283 | But every square inch is occupied.
clip_284 | Climbing over the tightly packed bodies
clip_285 | is the only way across the crowd.
clip_286 | Those beneath can get crushed to death.
clip_287 | A stampede can occur out of nowhere.
clip_288 | Under these conditions, walruses are a danger to themselves.
clip_289 | Some manage to find space away from the crowds.
clip_290 | They struggle up the 80-meter cliffs,
clip_291 | an extraordinary challenge for a one-tonne animal used to sea ice.
clip_292 | At least up here there's space to rest.
clip_293 | A walrus's eyesight out of water is poor,
clip_294 | but they can sense the others down below.
clip_295 | As they get hungry, they need to return to the sea.
clip_296 | In their desperation to do so,
clip_297 | hundreds fall from heights they should never have scaled.
clip_298 | These mass gatherings of walrus are now happening almost every year.
clip_299 | So the lives of walruses, like those of polar bears and seals,
clip_300 | are changing.
clip_301 | All are living at the frontier of climate change,
clip_302 | and all are suffering as a consequence.
clip_303 | For now, the Arctic winter returns and the sea ice reforms.
clip_304 | Order is restored.
clip_305 | Relief for the many creatures that depend on the ice.
clip_306 | But for how much longer
clip_307 | will their frozen worlds be a part of life on our planet?
