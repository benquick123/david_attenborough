clip_1 | Just 50 years ago,
clip_2 | we finally ventured to the moon.
clip_3 | For the very first time, we looked back at our own planet.
clip_4 | Since then, the human population has more than doubled.
clip_5 | This series will celebrate the natural wonders that remain
clip_6 | and reveal what we must preserve
clip_7 | to ensure people and nature thrive.
clip_8 | This is a tropical forest.
clip_9 | A rain forest.
clip_10 | The richest habitat on Earth.
clip_11 | Exactly how many species rain forests contain is unknown,
clip_12 | but it runs into millions.
clip_13 | And new ones are discovered every week.
clip_14 | There are some, like this clouded leopard, we still know virtually nothing about.
clip_15 | Although they cover just seven percent of the world's land area,
clip_16 | jungles play a vital role in the health of the planet.
clip_17 | In the heart of Africa lies the Congo.
clip_18 | It is our planet's youngest rain forest, a mere 18,000 years old,
clip_19 | and it's the jungle with more big animals than any other.
clip_20 | A family of lowland gorillas.
clip_21 | They're led by this silverback, the dominant male.
clip_22 | He's as tall as a man, but twice the weight.
clip_23 | His family depend on him for survival.
clip_24 | As their guardian, he must keep a lookout for danger.
clip_25 | A rival male might usurp him and tear his family apart.
clip_26 | But there is one threat beyond his control.
clip_27 | In the last 20 years,
clip_28 | poaching for bushmeat has halved the Congo's gorilla population.
clip_29 | His kind are now critically endangered.
clip_30 | It's only a forest elephant, which needn't concern the silverback.
clip_31 | But the elephant has reason to be wary of poachers too.
clip_32 | Their long straight tusks are even more sought after
clip_33 | than those of their grassland cousins.
clip_34 | He follows paths
clip_35 | made by generations of elephants before him,
clip_36 | searching for food.
clip_37 | Like the elephant, the silverback's family will travel several kilometers a day,
clip_38 | looking for fruits and seeds.
clip_39 | They and the elephants are the gardeners of this jungle.
clip_40 | The seed dispersers.
clip_41 | And many of the trees here
clip_42 | owe their existence to these large animals.
clip_43 | Here, all paths eventually lead to Mbeli Bai.
clip_44 | Open areas like this are a unique feature of the Congo's jungles,
clip_45 | and there are more than a hundred dotted throughout the forest.
clip_46 | Known as bais, these clearings attract many of the jungle's inhabitants.
clip_47 | The silverback cautiously leads the way,
clip_48 | but his family are close behind.
clip_49 | The gorillas come to feed on aquatic plants rich in salt,
clip_50 | a mineral in short supply inside the forest,
clip_51 | but crucial to their survival.
clip_52 | Elephants mine salts from the mud using their trunks.
clip_53 | Or just drink the mineral-enriched water.
clip_54 | The silverback's family are not the only gorillas here.
clip_55 | Nearly 200 others also use this bai,
clip_56 | as well as more than 530 elephants,
clip_57 | a measure of Mbeli's importance.
clip_58 | For the elephants, the bais have another vital role.
clip_59 | Most of their lives are spent
clip_60 | roaming the vast forested interior on their own,
clip_61 | so it's only here they get a chance to meet others.
clip_62 | Unlike most of the Congo's other bais, Mbeli is well protected,
clip_63 | making it a refuge from poaching.
clip_64 | It's only when they leave that the danger returns.
clip_65 | And as the Congo's main seed dispersers,
clip_66 | the loss of its megafauna could have a far-reaching impact
clip_67 | on the future of our planet's second-largest rain forest.
clip_68 | Jungles may look the same,
clip_69 | but each is home to a unique cast of characters.
clip_70 | New Guinea is the world's largest jungle-covered island,
clip_71 | and more than half of its plants and animals
clip_72 | are found nowhere else on Earth.
clip_73 | Its turbulent geological past has shaped this vast island
clip_74 | into a dramatic landscape of mountains and valleys.
clip_75 | A process that isolated one species from another.
clip_76 | Separated in this way,
clip_77 | New Guinea's animals have become truly bizarre.
clip_78 | The male twelve-wired bird-of-paradise
clip_79 | is the only bird in the world that has tail ornaments like this,
clip_80 | used to tickle the face of a prospective mate.
clip_81 | From one crow-like ancestor,
clip_82 | birds-of-paradise have evolved into 40 different kinds.
clip_83 | Every corner of this island has its own version.
clip_84 | Meet the black sicklebill of New Guinea's highlands...
clip_85 | ...able to morph into some very un-birdlike shapes.
clip_86 | Each male bird-of-paradise has a unique display for attracting mates,
clip_87 | and none is more extraordinary
clip_88 | than the one that takes place on this stage.
clip_89 | For the owner, a western parotia, there's work to be done first.
clip_90 | Every morning, he clears his court of the night's fallen debris.
clip_91 | It's a vital chore if he wants to attract a mate.
clip_92 | Females only visit the tidiest courts,
clip_93 | so one rogue leaf might ruin his chances.
clip_94 | Perfect.
clip_95 | His obsessive housework pays off,
clip_96 | and a female drops in for a closer look.
clip_97 | Now is his chance to really impress,
clip_98 | but it won't be easy.
clip_99 | Females are very fussy,
clip_100 | and she'll expect his carefully choreographed routine
clip_101 | to be faultless.
clip_102 | He opens with a bow.
clip_103 | Next, his blue eye must flash yellow.
clip_104 | So far, so good.
clip_105 | He has all the moves.
clip_106 | Fancy footwork.
clip_107 | The whirling dervish.
clip_108 | The head plume shuffle, with spin.
clip_109 | Her erect head feathers and quivering wings
clip_110 | are a very encouraging sign.
clip_111 | His sidestep and head bob look good from any angle,
clip_112 | but his crowning glory
clip_113 | can only be appreciated from her perspective.
clip_114 | Wait for it.
clip_115 | There it is. A flash of his iridescent throat patch.
clip_116 | Her excitement grows.
clip_117 | His performance has been a triumph,
clip_118 | and he wins her approval.
clip_119 | New Guinea's isolation has created a unique variety of animals,
clip_120 | but the age of a forest has an even greater impact
clip_121 | on the diversity of life it contains.
clip_122 | The jungles of Borneo, in Southeast Asia,
clip_123 | have grown here for nearly 130 million years,
clip_124 | making them the oldest on Earth.
clip_125 | This limestone mountaintop in Borneo's highlands
clip_126 | was originally formed under the sea.
clip_127 | Time and rain has slowly shaped this jungle fortress
clip_128 | into these 40-meter towers.
clip_129 | The great age of this island's jungle is best illustrated
clip_130 | by one of the oldest predators on Earth.
clip_131 | A velvet worm.
clip_132 | Completely at home on the humid forest floor.
clip_133 | They've been here since the age of the dinosaurs,
clip_134 | and have remained virtually unchanged.
clip_135 | It detects its insect prey through vibration and touch.
clip_136 | But with no turn of speed,
clip_137 | how does it capture these fleet-footed critters?
clip_138 | The answer is stranger than fiction.
clip_139 | Glue guns.
clip_140 | The sticky slime hardens on impact,
clip_141 | trapping the luckless insect.
clip_142 | The velvet worm will inject the cockroach with digestive saliva,
clip_143 | and then suck out its insides.
clip_144 | The high humidity of the forest floor isn't just good for velvet worms.
clip_145 | It's perfect for fungi, too,
clip_146 | and Borneo's ancient jungles are rich in species.
clip_147 | By decomposing the dead,
clip_148 | the slime molds and fungi recycle scarce nutrients.
clip_149 | Time has made Borneo's jungles extraordinarily rich and diverse.
clip_150 | Here, in just a few hectares of forest,
clip_151 | there may be more kinds of plants than in the whole of Europe,
clip_152 | including some of the most specialized on Earth.
clip_153 | Over several weeks,
clip_154 | these growing tips inflate to form jugs or pitchers.
clip_155 | There are 39 kinds of pitcher plant in Borneo,
clip_156 | and most are found nowhere else.
clip_157 | To get the nutrients they need to survive, pitcher plants rely on animals,
clip_158 | often in surprising ways.
clip_159 | This is the mountain treeshrew, an animal found only in Borneo.
clip_160 | Every morning, the treeshrew visits his neighborhood pitchers.
clip_161 | It depends on the sugary solution
clip_162 | that exudes from hairs on the pitcher's lid.
clip_163 | When he's licked this lid dry, he'll move to another.
clip_164 | And then another.
clip_165 | Eventually, all that sugar can have only one result.
clip_166 | In return for the free food, the treeshrew leaves a gift.
clip_167 | Fertilizer for the plant.
clip_168 | All that's needed is an afternoon shower
clip_169 | to flush the shrew poo into the pitcher's bowl.
clip_170 | Without these added nitrates, the plant couldn't survive.
clip_171 | And the quest for nutrients has led some pitchers down a sinister path.
clip_172 | A gracilis pitcher plant
clip_173 | attracts ants to the underside of its lid with drops of nectar.
clip_174 | But what do the ants give in return?
clip_175 | It's a story that also depends on rain.
clip_176 | The force of the raindrops
clip_177 | make it impossible for the ants to hold on.
clip_178 | It's the plant world's only springboard trap.
clip_179 | This pitcher plant feeds on ant bodies.
clip_180 | All pitcher plants depend on animals for survival,
clip_181 | and one has even gone into business with a bat.
clip_182 | The woolly bat finds hemsleyana pitchers
clip_183 | because the plant's broad back wall reflects the bat's ultrasound.
clip_184 | The tube-like pitchers are the perfect roosting site.
clip_185 | The pitcher provides secure accommodation
clip_186 | and the plant is enriched by its guest's deposits.
clip_187 | Relationships like these have taken millions of years to evolve,
clip_188 | but many could be gone in a decade.
clip_189 | In the last 50 years, Borneo has lost over half of its jungle.
clip_190 | And it's even worse
clip_191 | on the neighboring islands of the Philippines.
clip_192 | Here, 90 percent of the primary rain forest has gone.
clip_193 | What's left is the last refuge for the world's rarest bird of prey.
clip_194 | The mighty Philippines eagle.
clip_195 | With just 400 pairs remaining,
clip_196 | a chick on a nest is a very scarce sight.
clip_197 | Scientists have tracked the mother since she was a year old.
clip_198 | Now aged ten, this is her first chick.
clip_199 | It's four months old, already nearly a meter tall,
clip_200 | and increasingly confident.
clip_201 | Although Mother still likes to give a helping hand.
clip_202 | The chick is very demanding.
clip_203 | She expects regular food drops,
clip_204 | but, like a toddler having a tantrum, she doesn't want any help at mealtimes.
clip_205 | Already, she's the same size as her father
clip_206 | and too big to argue with.
clip_207 | But if his youngster is to take her next steps,
clip_208 | he knows it's time for some tough love.
clip_209 | From now on, visits will be less frequent.
clip_210 | The parents drop by with an occasional food parcel,
clip_211 | but a small fruit bat isn't much to get excited about.
clip_212 | It's confusing
clip_213 | when your parents don't visit as frequently as they once did.
clip_214 | Every day, she calls,
clip_215 | but no one is paying any attention.
clip_216 | She's hungry,
clip_217 | and all that's left are scraps.
clip_218 | It's time to become a proper eagle.
clip_219 | Flapping strengthens flight muscles in two-meter wings.
clip_220 | Wings that will be used to carry off her hefty prey.
clip_221 | Though that skill is still some time off.
clip_222 | So far, she's never ventured beyond the security of her nest.
clip_223 | And with good reason.
clip_224 | There's a 70-meter drop to the forest floor.
clip_225 | A fall would be fatal.
clip_226 | It's a nervous moment, but she must persevere.
clip_227 | Right now, she's all toes and talons.
clip_228 | Sudden gusts of wind are not helpful when balancing over a death-defying drop,
clip_229 | and the daily downpours don't make it any easier.
clip_230 | Every day, she gets a little stronger and more confident.
clip_231 | Then, the day comes when confidence finally matches know-how.
clip_232 | Now is the moment to reach for the sky.
clip_233 | Her first ever flight from her nest tree.
clip_234 | It'll be nearly a year before she's fully independent.
clip_235 | Then, her survival will depend on finding a territory
clip_236 | with large stretches of unspoilt jungle.
clip_237 | In the Philippines' fragmented forest,
clip_238 | there's just too little prey for a supersized eagle.
clip_239 | But there is one jungle whose size is still legendary.
clip_240 | The Amazon basin is over 3,000 kilometers across
clip_241 | and home to half of our planet's remaining rain forest.
clip_242 | But there are challenges for those living in the Amazon's deep interior.
clip_243 | Black spider monkeys,
clip_244 | with eyes on a salt lick.
clip_245 | Being so far from the sea, salt is in short supply here,
clip_246 | so a visit to a lick is essential.
clip_247 | But first, they must be sure there are no predators lurking below.
clip_248 | A harmless agouti is a good sign.
clip_249 | This is the only time a spider monkey ever sets foot on the ground.
clip_250 | And if you have your head in a hole,
clip_251 | best to have a lookout.
clip_252 | Monkeys can't survive without these minerals,
clip_253 | and predators know it.
clip_254 | A warning from the lookout.
clip_255 | It's not a false alarm.
clip_256 | A jaguar.
clip_257 | Rarely seen, but the Amazon's top predator.
clip_258 | With the jaguar gone, the monkeys return,
clip_259 | but it's a risk.
clip_260 | Nobody knows when the predator will be back.
clip_261 | It's not just spider monkeys for whom fear must give way to need.
clip_262 | In the Amazon, salt licks are as vital as an oasis in a desert.
clip_263 | Noises could be friend or foe,
clip_264 | so every visitor must remain poised for flight.
clip_265 | It's a false alarm.
clip_266 | Just the harmless agouti again.
clip_267 | In the Amazon, every animal group has more species than anywhere else.
clip_268 | And that includes frogs.
clip_269 | There are thought to be over a thousand different kinds of them here,
clip_270 | and new ones are still being discovered.
clip_271 | Frogs are an indicator of a healthy forest,
clip_272 | but its most important residents are the jungle's smallest inhabitants.
clip_273 | There are thought to be over two million kinds of insect in the Amazon.
clip_274 | These are the most numerous.
clip_275 | A colony of leafcutter ants can run into the millions.
clip_276 | Each colony is a superorganism with a collective function...
clip_277 | to gather leaves and carry them back to their underground nests.
clip_278 | Within the territory of a leafcutter colony,
clip_279 | as much as a fifth of all new plant growth will be harvested by the ants.
clip_280 | Slicing through leaves with specialized mandibles,
clip_281 | they produce high frequency vibrations, which stiffens the leaf,
clip_282 | making it easier to cut.
clip_283 | Working together, they can strip a tree bare in 24 hours.
clip_284 | The trick is holding on to your leaf as you fall.
clip_285 | Easier said than done.
clip_286 | But best not to return to the nest empty-handed.
clip_287 | A leafcutter colony is like a mega-herbivore,
clip_288 | not dissimilar to an elephant in the Congo,
clip_289 | and their impact on the ecosystem is just as important.
clip_290 | The ants follow scent trails back to the nest,
clip_291 | dodging unexpected obstacles.
clip_292 | But to increase efficiency, the ants keep their paths clear of debris.
clip_293 | A leafcutter nest can be up to eight meters deep
clip_294 | and have thousands of interconnected chambers.
clip_295 | The workers carry the freshly harvested leaves
clip_296 | to special rooms for processing.
clip_297 | The leaves are not food, but used to create gardens of fungus,
clip_298 | which they feed to their larvae.
clip_299 | The success of the colony depends on keeping their gardens disease-free.
clip_300 | So, the ants have teamed up with bacteria to help control pathogens,
clip_301 | which would destroy their precious fungi.
clip_302 | Scientists now believe
clip_303 | these bacteria could provide new solutions to human diseases.
clip_304 | But as successful as these ants are,
clip_305 | the rain forest's diversity depends on no one species gaining the upper hand.
clip_306 | Here, ants don't have it all their own way.
clip_307 | This one is behaving oddly.
clip_308 | It seems compelled to climb upwards,
clip_309 | and is already several meters above the forest floor.
clip_310 | Something has taken control of its movements,
clip_311 | like a puppeteer pulling at the strings of a marionette.
clip_312 | There's just one final act, for which the ant has no choice.
clip_313 | It must find a place to bite down, tethering it to the vegetation.
clip_314 | With the ant in its death grip,
clip_315 | a parasitic fungus, Cordyceps, erupts from its body.
clip_316 | Finally, the fruiting body of the fungus bursts from its head.
clip_317 | From this bulbous container, spores will be cast into the air currents,
clip_318 | where they will claim more ant victims.
clip_319 | But it's not just ants.
clip_320 | Many others are infected by the Cordyceps fungus.
clip_321 | The more numerous a species is,
clip_322 | the more likely it is to fall victim to the killer fungus.
clip_323 | Checks and balances like these means no one species can ever dominate,
clip_324 | so protecting the jungle's incredible diversity.
clip_325 | But today, the diversity of the world's rain forests
clip_326 | is falling at an alarming rate,
clip_327 | and that is because of us.
clip_328 | We have now replaced up to 27 million hectares of virgin jungle
clip_329 | with a single species of tree.
clip_330 | This is oil palm,
clip_331 | one of the world's most productive crops.
clip_332 | But these monocultures
clip_333 | support only a fraction of the diversity found in primary rain forests,
clip_334 | and it is pushing many animals to extinction.
clip_335 | In the swamp forests of northern Sumatra, in Indonesia,
clip_336 | time is running out for one of our closest ancestors.
clip_337 | The orangutan.
clip_338 | A baby orangutan takes more than ten years to become independent.
clip_339 | Everything must be learned from its mother.
clip_340 | Like how to bridge the gaps between trees.
clip_341 | Survival depends on each orang
clip_342 | understanding its patch of forest perfectly.
clip_343 | Watching scientists have named this pair Ellie and Eden.
clip_344 | Ellie is 18 years old,
clip_345 | and Eden, her first baby, is three.
clip_346 | Right now, he needs a little bit of encouragement.
clip_347 | Like all orangutans,
clip_348 | Ellie has a mental map of her surroundings,
clip_349 | including the location of every fruiting tree.
clip_350 | Eden needs to learn this, too,
clip_351 | but for now, he must watch everything his mother does,
clip_352 | learning not just what's edible but also how to eat it.
clip_353 | Every day is a new lesson for Eden.
clip_354 | Here, ants are a big part of their diet, and there's a knack to gathering them.
clip_355 | Once tangled in Ellie's fur, they're easy to pick off.
clip_356 | For little Eden, it's all about watching and learning.
clip_357 | Eden's cousin, Louis, is more experienced.
clip_358 | Four years older than Eden,
clip_359 | he can move through the branches with ease.
clip_360 | It's taken a few years to master,
clip_361 | and it's clearly a skill he feels is worth showing off.
clip_362 | Conquering the treetops is just stage one in an orangutan's education.
clip_363 | To survive, Louis must learn more.
clip_364 | Much more.
clip_365 | His mother, Lisa, has found a rotten tree trunk
clip_366 | with lots of ants.
clip_367 | But this anting opportunity requires more know-how.
clip_368 | To get them, Lisa must break sections off.
clip_369 | At his age, Louis must do more than watch.
clip_370 | He must copy.
clip_371 | Not a bad effort.
clip_372 | But even at the age of seven, he's yet to master the art of ant capture.
clip_373 | Louis has much to learn.
clip_374 | Pluto, on the other hand, graduated a long time ago.
clip_375 | Thirty years old and nearly a hundred kilograms,
clip_376 | he is king of this jungle.
clip_377 | His cheek flanges are a sign of power,
clip_378 | something for Louis to aspire to.
clip_379 | Pluto is constantly on the lookout for food,
clip_380 | and he's just spotted a promising opportunity.
clip_381 | These wasps mean one thing to him.
clip_382 | Tasty grubs.
clip_383 | To get at them, he favors a smash-and-grab technique.
clip_384 | His thick fur protects him from most of the angry wasps,
clip_385 | but the rewards are worth risking a few stings.
clip_386 | Louis keeps his distance.
clip_387 | He would need to be a lot bigger and hairier
clip_388 | before he could do battle with wasps.
clip_389 | But here, there's one trick that can take half a lifetime to get to grips with.
clip_390 | Louis' mother, Lisa, has learned how to make tools from sticks,
clip_391 | to winkle out insects.
clip_392 | The orangutans living here
clip_393 | are the only ones in the world to have discovered this skill.
clip_394 | Louis must try and learn it too,
clip_395 | but it may be another eight years before he's as good as his mother.
clip_396 | This long education has made orangutans
clip_397 | particularly vulnerable to changes taking place in their forest.
clip_398 | It's now estimated that we lose 100 orangutans every week
clip_399 | from human activity.
clip_400 | Louis and Eden's generation could be the last wild orangutan.
clip_401 | When Pluto was their age, his jungle home stretched to the horizon.
clip_402 | Not anymore.
clip_403 | In the last four decades,
clip_404 | the pristine lowland jungle that orangutans depend on
clip_405 | has declined by a staggering 75 percent.
clip_406 | Across the world, we are losing tropical forest
clip_407 | at the rate of nearly 15 million hectares every year,
clip_408 | and with it, the planet's treasure trove of diversity.
clip_409 | Jungles store and capture more carbon than any other habitat on land.
clip_410 | They cool our planet,
clip_411 | provide food and medicines.
clip_412 | We lose them at our peril.
