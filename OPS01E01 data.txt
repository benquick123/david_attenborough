clip_1 | Just 50 years ago,
clip_2 | we finally ventured to the moon.
clip_3 | For the very first time, we look back at our own planet.
clip_4 | Since then, the human population has more than doubled.
clip_5 | This series will celebrate the natural wonders that remain,
clip_6 | and reveal what we must preserve
clip_7 | to ensure people and nature thrive.
clip_8 | When human beings built their first settlements
clip_9 | some 10,000 years ago,
clip_10 | the world around them,
clip_11 | on the land and in the sea,
clip_12 | was full of life.
clip_13 | For generations, this stable Eden nurtured our growing civilizations.
clip_14 | But now, in the space of just one human lifetime,
clip_15 | all that has changed.
clip_16 | In the last 50 years,
clip_17 | wildlife populations have, on average, declined by 60 percent.
clip_18 | For the first time in human history,
clip_19 | the stability of nature can no longer be taken for granted.
clip_20 | But the natural world is resilient.
clip_21 | Great riches still remain.
clip_22 | And with our help, the planet can recover.
clip_23 | Never has it been more important to understand how the natural world works,
clip_24 | and how to help it.
clip_25 | Wildlife still flourishes in astonishing numbers
clip_26 | in a few precious places.
clip_27 | Along the Peruvian coast of South America,
clip_28 | seabirds congregate in colonies millions strong.
clip_29 | They come here to breed.
clip_30 | Every morning, the birds leave their colonies
clip_31 | to fish in one of the richest seas on Earth.
clip_32 | It is an astonishing daily migration
clip_33 | of five million birds.
clip_34 | The huge flocks of cormorants and boobies are all seeking one thing:
clip_35 | anchovies.
clip_36 | The boobies carpet-bomb the shoals.
clip_37 | More and more birds join the feeding frenzy.
clip_38 | All in this immense assembly are here
clip_39 | because a powerful oceanic current, the Humboldt,
clip_40 | sweeps up from the Antarctic,
clip_41 | bringing with it rich nutrients from the ocean's depths.
clip_42 | 90 percent of the life in the oceans
clip_43 | is found in the shallow seas close to the coast.
clip_44 | Away from the land,
clip_45 | the seas, for the most part, are a blue desert.
clip_46 | But even these distant waters may be enriched
clip_47 | by a most unexpected connection to the land.
clip_48 | Some deserts,
clip_49 | often hundreds of kilometers from the ocean,
clip_50 | provide the raw materials for life.
clip_51 | Every year, winds sweep up two billion tons of dust into the sky.
clip_52 | At least a quarter of it eventually falls on the sea,
clip_53 | providing nutrients needed by the microscopic organisms
clip_54 | that are the foundations of ocean life.
clip_55 | Dolphins explore the vast, open ocean
clip_56 | in search of the riches that distant deserts may have nourished.
clip_57 | A shoal of mackerel has discovered a swarm of krill...
clip_58 | the small crustaceans
clip_59 | that feed on the ocean's floating microscopic plants.
clip_60 | But the mackerel themselves are food for the dolphins.
clip_61 | They drive the mackerel towards the surface,
clip_62 | and into the range of birds.
clip_63 | Shearwaters.
clip_64 | The wings that normally propel the birds through the air
clip_65 | now drive them six meters down through the water.
clip_66 | Whilst the birds pick off the top of the shoal...
clip_67 | the dolphins attack the underside.
clip_68 | After 20 minutes of feasting,
clip_69 | the predators from both the sea and the air
clip_70 | have had their fill.
clip_71 | The stability of life on our planet
clip_72 | relies on such connections between different habitats.
clip_73 | Water evaporating from the surface of the sea
clip_74 | condenses to form great clouds.
clip_75 | And these eventually release the fresh water as rain.
clip_76 | But these life-giving rains are not evenly spread over the land.
clip_77 | This vast salt pan in Africa
clip_78 | is all that remains of an ancient lake.
clip_79 | It's totally waterless and oven-hot.
clip_80 | Few places on the land are more hostile to life.
clip_81 | A few tracks cross it, made by animals searching unsuccessfully for water.
clip_82 | But very occasionally, this whole landscape is transformed.
clip_83 | A huge deluge drenches the salt pan.
clip_84 | Triggered by some unknown signal,
clip_85 | flocks of lesser flamingos arrive from thousands of kilometers away.
clip_86 | The algae that the flamingos feed on
clip_87 | have lain dormant as spores in the dust.
clip_88 | But most importantly,
clip_89 | the birds are here to breed.
clip_90 | Perfect conditions might occur only once in a decade.
clip_91 | The birds nest on an island far from the shore.
clip_92 | They build mounds of mud that raise up their eggs
clip_93 | and so keep them just marginally cooler than they would be at ground level.
clip_94 | The water surrounding the island is so salty
clip_95 | that predators do not venture into it.
clip_96 | So the nests are safe.
clip_97 | Thirty days later, thousands of chicks start to hatch.
clip_98 | But there is no shelter from the scorching sun.
clip_99 | The water that once surrounded their island, protecting them,
clip_100 | has now dried up altogether.
clip_101 | The last to hatch step out into a desperately harsh world.
clip_102 | Somehow or other, the growing chicks must find fresh water to drink.
clip_103 | They cannot yet fly, so they must walk, guided by some of the adults.
clip_104 | They may have to trek for 50 kilometers.
clip_105 | Some... cannot keep up.
clip_106 | The salt has solidified around their legs.
clip_107 | Most of the chicks, in spite of everything,
clip_108 | and having walked for days,
clip_109 | eventually reach fresh water.
clip_110 | It is the end of a long journey...
clip_111 | but only the first of the trials that will be imposed on these flamingos
clip_112 | by the irregularity of the rains.
clip_113 | If rainfall is more predictable and certain,
clip_114 | then life can flourish more richly,
clip_115 | both in numbers and variety.
clip_116 | The Serengeti plains in East Africa support over a million wildebeest.
clip_117 | The herds follow the seasonal rains,
clip_118 | grazing on the newly-sprouting grass that comes in their wake.
clip_119 | Each year, within a three-week period,
clip_120 | the females give birth to over a quarter of a million calves.
clip_121 | This youngster is just a few days old.
clip_122 | Playing strengthens its legs for the long journey that lies ahead.
clip_123 | The calf must stay close to its mother.
clip_124 | Without her milk, it would starve.
clip_125 | And the herds are always traveling,
clip_126 | following the rains as they drift across the plains
clip_127 | in order to find fresh grazing.
clip_128 | Eventually, they reach woodlands.
clip_129 | Hunting dogs.
clip_130 | Wildebeest calves are a favorite prey.
clip_131 | And the dogs are hungry.
clip_132 | The calf must stay with its mother, protected within the herd.
clip_133 | The dogs have incredible stamina...
clip_134 | but the calf is defended by the herd.
clip_135 | They need the calf on its own.
clip_136 | The mother blocks the dogs, shielding her calf.
clip_137 | It makes a run for safety.
clip_138 | And it just manages to get back to the herd.
clip_139 | The future of this whole migration depends on the regularity of the rains,
clip_140 | but also on the continued existence of the great open grasslands
clip_141 | across which the herds make their immense journeys.
clip_142 | In places where rains fall abundantly throughout the year, forests grow,
clip_143 | and in the warmth of the tropics,
clip_144 | they support an unparalleled richness of life.
clip_145 | Half of all the species of land-living animals
clip_146 | live in these stable worlds.
clip_147 | The sheer diversity is breathtaking.
clip_148 | We still have not catalogued
clip_149 | all the species that live in the tropical forests.
clip_150 | The relationships between them all are multitudinous and complex.
clip_151 | Plants often depend on animals to pollinate their flowers.
clip_152 | And these intimate connections
clip_153 | are just as important as the great global ones.
clip_154 | These are traps.
clip_155 | Flowers shaped like buckets,
clip_156 | produced by an orchid.
clip_157 | Each red bucket is filled with an oily liquid that drips from above.
clip_158 | Male orchid bees need a rich perfume with which to impress their females,
clip_159 | and the orchids provide it.
clip_160 | But the bucket is slippery,
clip_161 | and the liquid into which the bee has fallen is sticky.
clip_162 | The only way to get out
clip_163 | is through a narrow tunnel.
clip_164 | As it emerges, the bee is gripped tight.
clip_165 | And that gives enough time for the plant
clip_166 | to glue pollen sacs on the bee's back.
clip_167 | So the orchid has its pollen taken to another plant...
clip_168 | and the bee is rewarded with a perfume,
clip_169 | with which, when it recovers its strength,
clip_170 | it can woo a female.
clip_171 | There are no pronounced seasons in a rainforest.
clip_172 | It produces food in one form or another the year round.
clip_173 | It's so rich that the females of some birds
clip_174 | are able to raise their young entirely by themselves,
clip_175 | and that allows the males to spend their whole time attracting females...
clip_176 | ...as manakins do.
clip_177 | There are over 50 different species,
clip_178 | each with its own highly elaborate dance routine.
clip_179 | The golden-collared manakin
clip_180 | starts by clearing his dance floor.
clip_181 | A female arrives and he starts his routine,
clip_182 | rocketing from one perch to another.
clip_183 | She checks out every detail.
clip_184 | Finally, he performs his signature move.
clip_185 | The back-flip...
clip_186 | ...with twist.
clip_187 | Perfection.
clip_188 | The red-capped manakin has a very different act.
clip_189 | It's a kind of slither.
clip_190 | With wing snaps.
clip_191 | But it doesn't seem to be working.
clip_192 | She's seen enough.
clip_193 | The most complex routine is that developed by the blue manakin.
clip_194 | The lead male is supported by three junior dancers.
clip_195 | They practice together almost every day.
clip_196 | During rehearsals,
clip_197 | a young male in juvenile plumage stands in for the female.
clip_198 | The dance has to be perfectly synchronized.
clip_199 | With the lead male happy...
clip_200 | they're ready to present their dance to a female.
clip_201 | In a carousel of movements, each male takes his turn at the front.
clip_202 | The lead male performs the final move.
clip_203 | Have they done enough?
clip_204 | What's her decision?
clip_205 | It's...
clip_206 | a yes!
clip_207 | A great team effort.
clip_208 | Tropical forests cover only seven percent of the planet's lands.
clip_209 | Away from the tropics, where the weather is seasonal and cooler,
clip_210 | they're very different.
clip_211 | The greatest of all is the boreal forest
clip_212 | that extends right across North America and Eurasia.
clip_213 | It cannot grow during the frigid grip of winter.
clip_214 | The forests are a crucial refuge
clip_215 | for the relatively few species that are able to survive here.
clip_216 | As winter approaches,
clip_217 | caribou grazing on the open tundra to the north
clip_218 | head south to the forest to seek food and shelter.
clip_219 | Out here, temperatures may fall below minus 40 degrees centigrade.
clip_220 | The forest will give some protection from the worst of the weather.
clip_221 | But now the caribou are not traveling alone.
clip_222 | Wolves.
clip_223 | They live in the forest year-round.
clip_224 | And in the winter, they specialize in hunting caribou.
clip_225 | They must find the freshest tracks.
clip_226 | They move fast by avoiding the deep snow,
clip_227 | sticking to the hard-packed trails made by the caribou.
clip_228 | This wolf has found fresh scent.
clip_229 | The caribou must be close.
clip_230 | The herd chooses to stop to rest on a frozen lake.
clip_231 | Out in the open, they will be able to spot approaching danger.
clip_232 | And sure enough, the wolves catch up.
clip_233 | They start to test the caribou,
clip_234 | probing for any weakness.
clip_235 | Out on the open lake,
clip_236 | the caribou can outrun the wolves...
clip_237 | so the wolves drive them back into the forest.
clip_238 | Here, in the deep snow, progress is much harder and slower.
clip_239 | And, hidden by the trees, the wolves can get closer.
clip_240 | The hunt is on.
clip_241 | The pack must decide which particular caribou to target
clip_242 | and which trail to take.
clip_243 | As the caribou scatter,
clip_244 | the leading wolf takes a wrong turn.
clip_245 | It's a crucial mistake, and the wolves abandon the chase.
clip_246 | With the coming of spring, the caribou will head north once more,
clip_247 | leaving the wolves and the forest behind.
clip_248 | They will travel 600 kilometers, crossing mountains to reach the tundra,
clip_249 | where the spring grass will be sprouting again,
clip_250 | and they can give birth.
clip_251 | But these migrations are a shadow of what they once were.
clip_252 | The herd has lost nearly 70 percent of its numbers
clip_253 | in the last 20 years.
clip_254 | Their world and all of our planet is now changing fast.
clip_255 | At the furthest polar extremes
clip_256 | lie the frozen wildernesses of Antarctica and the Arctic.
clip_257 | Though they may seem remote to many of us,
clip_258 | the stability of these icy wastes is crucial to all life on the planet.
clip_259 | But in just 70 years, things have changed at a frightening pace.
clip_260 | The polar regions are warming faster than any other part of the planet.
clip_261 | The Arctic in the north is a frozen ocean,
clip_262 | and the sea ice, on which all life here depends,
clip_263 | is disappearing.
clip_264 | Polar bears
clip_265 | specialize in hunting seals out on the frozen ocean.
clip_266 | But that world is now, literally, melting beneath their feet.
clip_267 | The sea ice breaks up every year,
clip_268 | but now this is happening earlier,
clip_269 | and the bears' limited hunting season is getting shorter.
clip_270 | This is already having a profound impact.
clip_271 | Cubs are growing up underweight,
clip_272 | which reduces their chances of survival.
clip_273 | Within the lifetime of these cubs,
clip_274 | the Arctic in summer could be largely free of sea ice.
clip_275 | It's not just the sea ice that is vanishing.
clip_276 | The ice that lies on land is also changing fast.
clip_277 | This is Greenland,
clip_278 | a vast expanse of ice one-fifth the size of the United States.
clip_279 | This glacial ice, together with the sea ice,
clip_280 | protects our planet by reflecting solar radiation away from the surface
clip_281 | and so preventing the Earth from overheating.
clip_282 | But the Arctic is warming dramatically.
clip_283 | The leading edge of the Store Glacier may appear to be motionless,
clip_284 | but glaciers can move at up to 45 meters a day.
clip_285 | Where this one meets the sea, it towers 100 meters above the water,
clip_286 | and continues downward for another 400 meters
clip_287 | beneath the surface.
clip_288 | Over the last 20 years, Greenland has been losing ice.
clip_289 | And the rate of loss is accelerating.
clip_290 | These massive icefalls from the top of the glacier
clip_291 | are just the beginnings
clip_292 | of a far greater event.
clip_293 | A stretch of the front face of the glacier over a kilometer long
clip_294 | is starting to break away.
clip_295 | From 400 meters beneath the surface,
clip_296 | the hidden ice is surging upwards.
clip_297 | The breakaway of an iceberg the size of a skyscraper
clip_298 | generates a colossal tidal wave.
clip_299 | Within 20 minutes, 75 million tons of ice break free.
clip_300 | Glaciers have always released ice into the ocean,
clip_301 | but now this is happening nearly twice as fast
clip_302 | as it did ten years ago.
clip_303 | Around the world, ice is now feeding vast amounts of fresh water into the sea,
clip_304 | raising sea levels, changing salinity, and disrupting ocean currents.
clip_305 | Without the Humboldt Current, the coast of Peru would fall silent.
clip_306 | The seabird spectacle would be no more.
clip_307 | All across our planet, crucial connections are being disrupted.
clip_308 | The stability that we and all life relies upon is being lost.
clip_309 | What we do in the next 20 years
clip_310 | will determine the future for all life on Earth.
clip_311 | The rest of this series will explore the planet's most important habitats,
clip_312 | and celebrate the life they still support.
clip_313 | We will reveal what must be preserved
clip_314 | if we are to ensure a future where humans and nature can thrive.
