clip_1 | Just 50 years ago,
clip_2 | we finally ventured to the moon.
clip_3 | For the very first time,
clip_4 | we looked back at our own planet.
clip_5 | Since then, the human population has more than doubled.
clip_6 | This series will celebrate the natural wonders that remain
clip_7 | and reveal what we must preserve
clip_8 | to ensure people and nature thrive.
clip_9 | Fresh water.
clip_10 | Everything that lives on land, animal or plant,
clip_11 | depends upon it.
clip_12 | Yet only one percent of it is within reach.
clip_13 | The desert of central Australia.
clip_14 | One of the hottest, driest places on Earth.
clip_15 | Virtually nothing can live here for any length of time.
clip_16 | Yet once a decade, this vast, empty desert is transformed.
clip_17 | For that to happen, a chain reaction has to be triggered
clip_18 | two thousand kilometers to the north.
clip_19 | There, each year, the moisture-laden clouds of the monsoon
clip_20 | begin to build.
clip_21 | Eventually they burst, and the process begins.
clip_22 | Riverbeds that have been dry for years suddenly fill.
clip_23 | The torrents join together and race towards the interior
clip_24 | and the lowest land on the continent.
clip_25 | Here, they flood over the desert and create Australia's largest lake,
clip_26 | Kati Thanda, Lake Eyre.
clip_27 | Huge numbers of fish swim down these wide waterways
clip_28 | and into the growing lake.
clip_29 | Pelicans arrive from Australia's coasts, hundreds of kilometers away.
clip_30 | Many will only see the lake fill once in their entire lives,
clip_31 | so how they know the lake has formed, and in which direction to reach it,
clip_32 | is still a mystery.
clip_33 | These new waters now contain so much food that the birds start to breed.
clip_34 | But the clock is ticking.
clip_35 | The pelicans feed...
clip_36 | and feed...
clip_37 | and feed.
clip_38 | The chicks must grow quickly,
clip_39 | for they have to be strong enough to leave within a matter of weeks.
clip_40 | But time is short,
clip_41 | for the parents will only be able to find food
clip_42 | while the water remains.
clip_43 | The young pelicans set off on their first long journey.
clip_44 | It will be a demanding one, to the coast,
clip_45 | and the nearest is 500 kilometers away.
clip_46 | The lake will soon dry,
clip_47 | and water may not return here for another decade.
clip_48 | This boom to bust transformation is an exceptional event.
clip_49 | But everywhere, the availability of fresh water
clip_50 | is becoming increasingly unpredictable and uncertain.
clip_51 | Much of the planet's fresh water, however, is locked away.
clip_52 | Almost two-thirds of it lies frozen around the poles.
clip_53 | This ice is several kilometers thick
clip_54 | and may have been lying here for millions of years.
clip_55 | Every summer, some of it melts
clip_56 | and carves its way into the heart of the glaciers.
clip_57 | These great caves are beautiful and romantic,
clip_58 | but they're also dangerous places, for glaciers are always on the move.
clip_59 | Even away from the poles,
clip_60 | much of the land's fresh water freezes each winter.
clip_61 | But when spring arrives, this vast snowy reservoir melts
clip_62 | and a great journey begins.
clip_63 | Racing down the steep mountain slopes,
clip_64 | the ice-cold waters collect a life-giving ingredient...
clip_65 | oxygen.
clip_66 | Here, on the rivers of the Andes in South America,
clip_67 | there is a living to be made
clip_68 | for those that can cope with the powerful currents.
clip_69 | And torrent ducks can.
clip_70 | These chilly headwaters may be oxygen-rich,
clip_71 | but they contain few nutrients.
clip_72 | The torrent ducks collect what little food there is
clip_73 | from below the surface.
clip_74 | Stonefly and mayfly larvae have gills,
clip_75 | with which they extract oxygen from the water.
clip_76 | Their flattened bodies resist the relentless pull of the current.
clip_77 | Black fly larvae.
clip_78 | One of the ducks' favorite prey.
clip_79 | Their specialized mouthparts filter out the tiny particles of food
clip_80 | as they race by.
clip_81 | Hooks at the rear end anchor them to the rocks,
clip_82 | but the current is sometimes irresistible.
clip_83 | However, they have a special safety line, with which they can pull themselves back.
clip_84 | Every year, visitors come to these rushing, oxygen-rich waters.
clip_85 | Salmon.
clip_86 | They have spent most of their lives in the Pacific Ocean.
clip_87 | Now, fully grown, they're returning to the particular rivers in North America
clip_88 | where they will now lay their eggs.
clip_89 | Salmon have an extraordinary ability to leap up waterfalls,
clip_90 | but even they cannot, unaided, cross the dams that we have built.
clip_91 | Today, Pacific salmon number less than one percent of the numbers they used to,
clip_92 | and that's causing problems for many other animals.
clip_93 | Alaskan brown bears wait for them at the waterfalls.
clip_94 | Without these fish,
clip_95 | the bears cannot build up the fat reserves they need
clip_96 | to sustain themselves through their long winter hibernation.
clip_97 | There is fierce competition for the best fishing spots.
clip_98 | Where water flows over hard rock, it collects few nutrients,
clip_99 | so few plants can grow in it.
clip_100 | Here, in South America, however,
clip_101 | this plant, Macarenia, manages to flourish.
clip_102 | For a few months each year,
clip_103 | when the water level is low enough for sunlight to reach the bottom,
clip_104 | the Macarenia bursts into bloom.
clip_105 | This is the Caño Cristales, Colombia's rainbow river.
clip_106 | Sometimes, however, water disappears underground,
clip_107 | beyond the reach of light,
clip_108 | and there, no plants can live.
clip_109 | Thirty percent of the planet's fresh water lies beneath the surface of the land,
clip_110 | either within the substance of porous rocks
clip_111 | or as subterranean lakes and rivers.
clip_112 | Made slightly acid by rain,
clip_113 | it slowly dissolves limestone, creating great caves.
clip_114 | A labyrinth of such passages and chambers underlies much of the state of Florida.
clip_115 | For the most part, they're barren.
clip_116 | But where the water comes to the surface, it's full of life.
clip_117 | Fish are abundant.
clip_118 | And so are fish eaters.
clip_119 | Otters.
clip_120 | All over the state, fresh water bubbles to the surface
clip_121 | from the greatest concentration of springs on Earth.
clip_122 | They feed rivers and pools, in which all kinds of life flourish,
clip_123 | including one of Florida's specialities...
clip_124 | manatees.
clip_125 | Many spend the summer in the sea,
clip_126 | but when winter approaches, they swim up the rivers,
clip_127 | which are relatively warm.
clip_128 | And there they graze on an abundance of freshwater plants.
clip_129 | But human beings are now taking so much water from these springs,
clip_130 | and polluting many of the others,
clip_131 | that the manatees are losing their winter homes.
clip_132 | Rivers, being comparatively shallow, warm quickly,
clip_133 | and in spring, across Europe,
clip_134 | the rising temperatures trigger a sudden surge of life.
clip_135 | On Hungary's Tisza River, giant mayfly are starting to emerge.
clip_136 | For three years, they've lived underwater as larvae.
clip_137 | Now, in just three hours,
clip_138 | millions of the winged adults dance together and mate before they die.
clip_139 | This extraordinary spectacle was once common in Eastern Europe,
clip_140 | but so many rivers now have stabilized banks
clip_141 | and are badly polluted
clip_142 | that the mayflies have largely disappeared.
clip_143 | But when the rivers are clean, wildlife is quick to return.
clip_144 | The kingfisher, the most glorious of divers.
clip_145 | The osprey, the most skillful of graspers.
clip_146 | Iguazu, on the frontier between Brazil and Argentina.
clip_147 | These are the largest waterfalls on the planet.
clip_148 | Thousands of tons of fresh water thunder over them every second.
clip_149 | Much of Iguazu's water comes from the Amazon rainforest,
clip_150 | a thousand kilometers away.
clip_151 | There, it rose as vapor from the surface of the jungle canopy.
clip_152 | A single tree can give off a thousand liters a day.
clip_153 | As the vapor rises into the sky, it condenses into clouds.
clip_154 | Twenty billion tons of water leave the forest each day,
clip_155 | more than travels down the Amazon River itself.
clip_156 | If the rainforest is destroyed,
clip_157 | this life-giving cycle will be broken.
clip_158 | As the clouds travel across the continent, they shed their water,
clip_159 | irrigating farmland and forest alike.
clip_160 | And on the plains of Brazil,
clip_161 | they create the largest tropical wetland on Earth,
clip_162 | the Pantanal.
clip_163 | Each year, however, seasonal changes reduce the river's flow,
clip_164 | and the Pantanal shrinks to just a few river channels.
clip_165 | This suits the top predator very well.
clip_166 | The jaguar.
clip_167 | It's a competent swimmer, but in water,
clip_168 | it can't make the killing pounce which makes it such a fearsome hunter.
clip_169 | Now, in the dry season,
clip_170 | the banks can get somewhat crowded.
clip_171 | But the jaguar has spotted prey on the river's edge.
clip_172 | Capybara.
clip_173 | It must get close to be successful.
clip_174 | Two capybara incautiously are standing in the shallows.
clip_175 | They have seen one another.
clip_176 | Which will run first?
clip_177 | Farther along the river, dense vegetation provides better cover,
clip_178 | but the bank here is quite high.
clip_179 | Capybara have acute hearing.
clip_180 | One noisy footfall...
clip_181 | ...and the chance is lost.
clip_182 | Another failure.
clip_183 | Perhaps it's time to try a different prey.
clip_184 | Tackling one of these would be risky,
clip_185 | but the jaguar is really hungry.
clip_186 | If a jaguar is to catch a caiman,
clip_187 | it must bite its neck and then hold on to prevent the caiman striking back.
clip_188 | It has to get into a position directly above its prey.
clip_189 | This is dangerous.
clip_190 | The caiman rolls to try and drown the jaguar.
clip_191 | Predator and prey seem evenly matched.
clip_192 | The jaguar won't let go.
clip_193 | After 20 minutes, and near to exhaustion, the jaguar wins.
clip_194 | Sometimes, a river's downward journey is interrupted by lakes.
clip_195 | Together, they contain 40 times more water than all the world's rivers combined.
clip_196 | Africa's Lake Tanganyika
clip_197 | holds almost a fifth of all accessible fresh water on Earth.
clip_198 | But, considering its great size, Tanganyika contains little life.
clip_199 | It's almost a kilometer and a half deep,
clip_200 | but at the bottom the water barely moves and there is no oxygen.
clip_201 | It's only close to the surface, in its top 150 meters,
clip_202 | that the water contains enough oxygen for life to exist.
clip_203 | But here, it flourishes in abundance.
clip_204 | Two hundred and fifty species of cichlid fish have evolved here,
clip_205 | many of which are found nowhere else.
clip_206 | Competition in these crowded waters is intense.
clip_207 | A male callipterus cichlid collects shells.
clip_208 | The more shells a male has, the more females he will attract.
clip_209 | And this one is doing very well.
clip_210 | His neighbor has a rather smaller mound.
clip_211 | And the neighbor is a thief.
clip_212 | As soon as he turns his back,
clip_213 | the thief swoops in...
clip_214 | and steals a shell.
clip_215 | The hardworking owner of the larger mound doesn't seem to notice.
clip_216 | So, the thief commits the crime again...
clip_217 | and again...
clip_218 | until he has built the largest mound.
clip_219 | The shells are not just for display.
clip_220 | They will be used by the females as cradles.
clip_221 | One arrives.
clip_222 | She's tiny, only a tenth of his size.
clip_223 | She's so small, she can slip inside a shell.
clip_224 | There, she lays her eggs, and the male quickly fertilizes them.
clip_225 | She will then stay inside protecting them for up to a fortnight until they hatch.
clip_226 | The emperor,
clip_227 | the largest of all the cichlids in Tanganyika.
clip_228 | At almost a meter long, this female must raise her young in the open.
clip_229 | Guarding them is therefore a full-time job for both parents.
clip_230 | But the future for all these fish is uncertain.
clip_231 | As global temperatures rise, Lake Tanganyika is warming.
clip_232 | Its waters are no longer mixing as well as they once did,
clip_233 | so the top oxygenated layer is reducing.
clip_234 | The Mekong River in Southeast Asia.
clip_235 | Four thousand kilometers long and with the widest falls anywhere.
clip_236 | Today, over 60 million people depend upon it for their livelihood.
clip_237 | The monsoon rains create such a colossal surge of water
clip_238 | that the falls themselves almost disappear.
clip_239 | The water is loaded with sediment,
clip_240 | collected during the Mekong's long journey from the Tibetan Plateau.
clip_241 | Even before the flood, the water covers a vast area of land.
clip_242 | These exposed roots are evidence
clip_243 | of the great rise in water level that is to come.
clip_244 | When the main flood does arrive,
clip_245 | the trees are submerged up to their branches.
clip_246 | For a few months, the floodwaters create the planet's greatest breeding grounds
clip_247 | for freshwater fish.
clip_248 | One species has a particularly ingenious solution
clip_249 | to the problems of living in shallow, oxygen-poor water.
clip_250 | The Siamese fighting fish.
clip_251 | The male breathes by gulping air from the surface,
clip_252 | and during the breeding season
clip_253 | he uses that ability to build a raft of bubbles.
clip_254 | Day after day he labors.
clip_255 | A female, waiting nearby, rises to inspect the raft.
clip_256 | They wrap themselves around one another in a tender embrace.
clip_257 | This union encourages her to release her eggs.
clip_258 | As they sink downwards, the male fertilizes them.
clip_259 | Both carefully collect them,
clip_260 | and then blow them, one by one, into the bubble nest.
clip_261 | Oxygen is scarce in these stagnant waters,
clip_262 | but the eggs will get enough from the bubbles
clip_263 | to allow them to develop.
clip_264 | The climax of the flood is still to come.
clip_265 | Eventually, so much water surges down the Mekong
clip_266 | that the Tonlé Sap Lake expands to five times its dry-season size.
clip_267 | Vast numbers of fish now swim into these new feeding grounds.
clip_268 | People have harvested this seasonal event for millennia.
clip_269 | They set nets across half of the river,
clip_270 | leaving the other half free
clip_271 | for the rest of the fish to swim on and breed.
clip_272 | The Mekong, in fact, supports the largest inland fishery in the world.
clip_273 | One-fifth of all the freshwater fish caught by people worldwide
clip_274 | comes from this one river system.
clip_275 | But the future of the Mekong,
clip_276 | like that of so many other rivers around the world,
clip_277 | is increasingly at risk.
clip_278 | We have changed the natural flow
clip_279 | of more than two-thirds of the planet's longest rivers
clip_280 | by, amongst other things, building dams across them.
clip_281 | So now, many rivers across the world no longer flow.
clip_282 | Here in East Africa, in Ruaha, Tanzania,
clip_283 | these elephants are searching for water.
clip_284 | Each needs to drink 200 liters every day, and there doesn't seem to be any here.
clip_285 | But the elephants know that baobab wood contains a lot of moisture.
clip_286 | And in an emergency, they eat it in great quantities.
clip_287 | Lions also need water.
clip_288 | And conveniently for the lions, water is where their prey will gather.
clip_289 | So both predators and prey head for the rivers.
clip_290 | Until 30 years ago,
clip_291 | rivers in this part of Africa never ran dry.
clip_292 | Now, agriculture upstream is taking great quantities,
clip_293 | and during the dry season, the rivers shrink into isolated pools.
clip_294 | Hippos rely on flowing water to keep themselves cool during the day,
clip_295 | but now they have to make do with mud.
clip_296 | As the water level falls still further, they cram together.
clip_297 | Tempers begin to fray.
clip_298 | Each day, the mud pools shrink further, and the hippos' plight worsens.
clip_299 | Buffalo, in the urgent search for water.
clip_300 | The lions are already here at this water hole.
clip_301 | However, the buffalo are driven on by their desperate need for fresh water.
clip_302 | They need to drink every day.
clip_303 | Every drink is now a risk,
clip_304 | but the buffalo have no choice.
clip_305 | As the drought continues, the buffalo begin to weaken.
clip_306 | The odds are changing, in the lions' favor.
clip_307 | The elephants have reached their river.
clip_308 | Nothing else is here because it's dry.
clip_309 | But elephants can find water where others can't.
clip_310 | They use their trunks to dig holes in the sand of the riverbed.
clip_311 | The extraordinary sense of smell
clip_312 | that enables them to detect open water from kilometers away
clip_313 | also helps them to locate places underground
clip_314 | where it lies closest to the surface.
clip_315 | In severe droughts, the wells they dig can be their lifeline.
clip_316 | The hardships of the dry season have always been part of life
clip_317 | on East Africa's plains,
clip_318 | but as the planet warms,
clip_319 | and we ourselves take so much water for our own purposes,
clip_320 | the droughts are becoming more frequent and more severe.
clip_321 | The Platte River, in Nebraska, North America.
clip_322 | Each year, sandhill cranes arrive here as they travel north across America
clip_323 | on one of the last great migrations made by any animal.
clip_324 | It's one of their crucial staging posts.
clip_325 | The river once flooded the prairie for a mile in all directions.
clip_326 | This was a perfect place for them to feed and rest.
clip_327 | Now, we have dammed the river
clip_328 | and taken so much of its water for our own use
clip_329 | that there is little space left for the cranes.
clip_330 | But conservationists now manage the river's flow in such a way
clip_331 | that it still creates the sandbanks the cranes need.
clip_332 | We are not alone in our need for water,
clip_333 | but we have the ability to ensure the fresh waters of the world do flow,
clip_334 | and we alone can determine how they are shared.
clip_335 | Please visit ourplanet.com to discover what we need to do now
clip_336 | to ensure fresh water keeps flowing.
