clip_1 | Just 50 years ago,
clip_2 | we finally ventured to the moon.
clip_3 | For the very first time, we looked back at our own planet.
clip_4 | Since then, the human population has more than doubled.
clip_5 | This series will celebrate the natural wonders that remain
clip_6 | and reveal what we must preserve
clip_7 | to ensure people and nature thrive.
clip_8 | Forests.
clip_9 | Over half of all the world's trees, evergreen and deciduous,
clip_10 | stand in these great assemblies.
clip_11 | For many of us, they are places of mystery and darkness.
clip_12 | They are key to our climate, and home to countless unique species.
clip_13 | In the past, we have destroyed them without hesitation.
clip_14 | Yet, forests do have an astonishing ability to recover.
clip_15 | This is the southern edge of the boreal forest,
clip_16 | the forest that dominates the far north.
clip_17 | It stretches eastwards across Russia for thousands of kilometers,
clip_18 | and now, in the middle of winter, it's largely silent,
clip_19 | seemingly empty of animals of any kind.
clip_20 | But this is the home of an animal so rare it's almost mythical.
clip_21 | A Siberian tiger.
clip_22 | There are less than 600 of them.
clip_23 | These are the most intimate pictures of them in the wild yet taken.
clip_24 | A male Siberian tiger patrols a territory of almost 2,000 square kilometers,
clip_25 | and it has to do so if it is to find enough prey
clip_26 | to keep itself alive during the long winter.
clip_27 | This is an impoverished land where food of any kind is scarce.
clip_28 | A pine cone.
clip_29 | Pine nuts provide vital energy during the winter months.
clip_30 | Wild boar depend on these nuts.
clip_31 | For them, it has to be grab and go,
clip_32 | for they themselves are food for a tiger.
clip_33 | This game of hide-and-seek is played out over vast areas of forest,
clip_34 | as all the animals search for the life-giving stands of pine.
clip_35 | Poaching has taken the Siberian tiger to the brink of extinction,
clip_36 | but, since the 1980s, their numbers have slowly increased.
clip_37 | These rare glimpses reveal
clip_38 | that their future still depends on having vast areas of forest in which to hunt.
clip_39 | The boreal forest extends from Russia in the east,
clip_40 | across Europe, to North America.
clip_41 | It contains 750 billion trees,
clip_42 | and it stores over 40 percent of the world's carbon,
clip_43 | making it a vital element in the fight against climate change.
clip_44 | During the winter, the days are so short and the temperature so low,
clip_45 | that growth is at a standstill.
clip_46 | This far north, the forest can support very few animals
clip_47 | compared to the rain forests of the tropics.
clip_48 | Many are dependent on the supplement to be found in its rivers.
clip_49 | In western Alaska, both in spring and, as now, in autumn,
clip_50 | salmon, having left the ocean,
clip_51 | swim up rivers to reach their ancestral spawning grounds.
clip_52 | Their journey from the sea into the forest represents
clip_53 | the greatest transfer of nutrients from one habitat to another
clip_54 | anywhere on Earth.
clip_55 | The fish are crucial seasonal food
clip_56 | for all the predators that live in this forest.
clip_57 | Bald eagles live here the year round and nest close to the river.
clip_58 | Young eagles, still without white heads,
clip_59 | spend their first years searching for food in the forest.
clip_60 | But, like this four-year-old female,
clip_61 | they're now big enough to try and claim a place on the river.
clip_62 | At first, all she can get are the scraps left by others.
clip_63 | And she can't get even these without a fight.
clip_64 | She will have to look elsewhere.
clip_65 | The boreal forest may be vast,
clip_66 | but the places where the salmon spawn are known to all the predators.
clip_67 | As the rivers begin to freeze over, competition becomes even more intense.
clip_68 | This youngster is lucky, but her success is noticed immediately.
clip_69 | She does have one advantage.
clip_70 | Females, even when young, are larger than the males.
clip_71 | And here, size matters.
clip_72 | As winter advances,
clip_73 | young and old have to meet the challenge of the intense cold.
clip_74 | If she can survive, she will have gained a place
clip_75 | in one of the greatest and harshest forests on Earth.
clip_76 | A little further south
clip_77 | stand the last of the great redwood forests.
clip_78 | Not so long ago, these great trees grew throughout the Pacific Northwest.
clip_79 | Now, only five percent of them remain.
clip_80 | Here, conditions are less harsh.
clip_81 | Winds bring in warm, humid air from the Pacific Ocean,
clip_82 | so the trees are able to grow the year round.
clip_83 | Hidden in the vegetation of the moist forest floor
clip_84 | is a richly populated underworld.
clip_85 | A male rough-skinned newt.
clip_86 | Every spring, he is driven by a mysterious urge
clip_87 | to return to the pool where he hatched as a tadpole.
clip_88 | And he needs to get there quickly.
clip_89 | Because there are lots of others like him...
clip_90 | with exactly the same idea.
clip_91 | They're all searching for a female,
clip_92 | but trekking across hundreds of meters of old-growth forest is not easy.
clip_93 | There is strong competition.
clip_94 | And the female is anxious to get going.
clip_95 | Once paired, he hangs on,
clip_96 | for she may take several hours to discharge all her eggs.
clip_97 | Other males are only too eager to displace him if they can.
clip_98 | Competition is so vigorous
clip_99 | that the females in the center of these writhing balls
clip_100 | have been known to drown for lack of air.
clip_101 | But her first partner maintains his grip.
clip_102 | Within weeks, their tadpoles will hatch.
clip_103 | And none too soon, for the forest is about to change dramatically.
clip_104 | By the end of the summer, the sun has baked the forest so intensely
clip_105 | that they are as dry as tinder.
clip_106 | Strong winds drive the flames,
clip_107 | and temperatures rise to 700 degrees Celsius.
clip_108 | Its aftermath is seemingly total destruction.
clip_109 | The wind, scouring the newly exposed forest floor,
clip_110 | kicks up dust devils of ash.
clip_111 | The ground appears to be devoid of life.
clip_112 | But the forest is far from dead.
clip_113 | Within only a few months,
clip_114 | flowers and tree seedlings will rise from the soil.
clip_115 | Many, in fact, would not have germinated had they not received a baptism of fire.
clip_116 | Light streaming down through the newly opened canopy
clip_117 | provides the energy for a surge of new growth.
clip_118 | The older, well-established redwoods have survived,
clip_119 | protected by their thick, fire-resistant bark.
clip_120 | This natural resilience is essential to the continued health of these forests.
clip_121 | Most forests, however, cannot recover on their own.
clip_122 | Many are helped to recover by animals.
clip_123 | The trees and their inhabitants are interdependent.
clip_124 | And nowhere is this dependence more apparent
clip_125 | than in India's Western Ghats.
clip_126 | This globally important habitat
clip_127 | contains a third of all animal species found in India.
clip_128 | Lion-tailed macaques.
clip_129 | They feed on the fruits of many kinds of tree,
clip_130 | and, in doing so, they distribute the seeds,
clip_131 | which will emerge unscathed with their droppings.
clip_132 | But few monkeys travel very far.
clip_133 | If plants are to distribute their seeds across great distances,
clip_134 | they need another kind of transport.
clip_135 | Wings.
clip_136 | Great hornbills have wings that are almost two meters across,
clip_137 | and they enable the birds to travel long distances in search of food.
clip_138 | Hornbills feed on the fruit of 40 or so different kinds of trees,
clip_139 | and transport the indigestible seeds they contain
clip_140 | all over the Western Ghats.
clip_141 | So, it's to the trees' advantage to attract the hornbill's attention.
clip_142 | The figs themselves, although they taste nice,
clip_143 | are not, in fact, very nutritious,
clip_144 | so the hornbills have to eat great quantities of them.
clip_145 | It can be tiring work.
clip_146 | But it's not a free-for-all.
clip_147 | A single fig tree in fruit attracts great numbers of hornbills.
clip_148 | Competition between them is intense.
clip_149 | This aerial jousting between males has never been filmed before
clip_150 | and its purpose is not really understood.
clip_151 | It may be that the birds are simply squabbling over food,
clip_152 | but it seems rather more than that.
clip_153 | The winner is able to demonstrate his strength and skill
clip_154 | to visiting females.
clip_155 | The males certainly seem keen to ingratiate themselves.
clip_156 | It's particularly important for hornbills to get the best pairing
clip_157 | because, once established, the bond between male and female
clip_158 | will last a lifetime.
clip_159 | The forest also benefits from these squabbles,
clip_160 | because even a defeated hornbill
clip_161 | will spread seeds over wide areas as he searches for his next meal.
clip_162 | The relationship between trees and animals in a forest
clip_163 | is not always so harmonious.
clip_164 | This is Africa's largest forest, the Miombo,
clip_165 | named after one of its common trees.
clip_166 | It stretches for over a thousand miles,
clip_167 | from Angola in the west to Mozambique in the east.
clip_168 | At the height of the dry season,
clip_169 | the Miombo attracts animals from all across southern Africa.
clip_170 | Elephants prefer grass if they can get it. It's very nutritious.
clip_171 | In its absence,
clip_172 | they browse on the abundant leaves and branches of the Miombo.
clip_173 | But they're not the only hungry ones here.
clip_174 | These mopane worms
clip_175 | are not worms, of course, but caterpillars.
clip_176 | They hatch simultaneously in huge numbers.
clip_177 | And just as the forest is putting out new leaves,
clip_178 | they begin their attack.
clip_179 | They feed so voraciously
clip_180 | that in just six weeks they increase their size 40 times.
clip_181 | By the time they're fully developed, this million-strong army
clip_182 | will have stripped the entire forest of its foliage.
clip_183 | But the Miombo bounces back.
clip_184 | With the caterpillars gone,
clip_185 | the trees produce a second growth of leaves.
clip_186 | This fresh feast then attracts elephants.
clip_187 | They are less fussy than the caterpillars.
clip_188 | They will eat every part of the tree.
clip_189 | And a hungry elephant can munch through 200 kilos of vegetation in a day.
clip_190 | Yet, even this destruction has its benefits.
clip_191 | It shapes the forest in a way that helps one of Africa's most endangered animals.
clip_192 | Hunting dogs.
clip_193 | They're seen most frequently, and most easily, on grasslands.
clip_194 | But, in fact, these open forests are their preferred habitat.
clip_195 | Browsing elephants open up a forest,
clip_196 | and that attracts the animals on which the dogs prey.
clip_197 | For the dogs, the Miombo forest is perfect hunting country.
clip_198 | And it's also an excellent place in which to bring up pups.
clip_199 | The pups greet the adults returning from a hunt
clip_200 | with great excitement.
clip_201 | Food.
clip_202 | The first three months of the pups' lives are spent sheltering underground.
clip_203 | Now, they are confident enough
clip_204 | to stay out in the open for much of the time.
clip_205 | And then, like all puppies, they have fun.
clip_206 | Playing is important for the youngsters,
clip_207 | for as they do so, they establish the social bonds
clip_208 | that they will need when they start to hunt together as a team.
clip_209 | The Miombo has always been important for hunting dogs,
clip_210 | both as a place to find prey and as a refuge.
clip_211 | Never has it been more crucial
clip_212 | for the survival of this endangered species than now.
clip_213 | But they will only survive if other creatures are here
clip_214 | to create the kind of habitat they need.
clip_215 | Madagascar has a forest
clip_216 | dominated uniquely by one of the oddest of trees.
clip_217 | Baobabs.
clip_218 | The island has been isolated for over 80 million years.
clip_219 | During that immensity of time, its animals and plants
clip_220 | have evolved into forms quite different from any elsewhere.
clip_221 | This makes them one of the most precious forests on our planet.
clip_222 | This is not a monkey, but a distant relative, a lemur,
clip_223 | and there are at least 40 different kinds of lemurs,
clip_224 | all unique to Madagascar and all endangered.
clip_225 | Lemurs are crucial to the forest.
clip_226 | Without them, some species of tree cannot survive.
clip_227 | The forest even has its own specialized lemur hunter.
clip_228 | It's Madagascar's top predator,
clip_229 | and its presence is cause for alarm.
clip_230 | It can grow to a length of one and a half meters,
clip_231 | and it's very seldom seen in the wild.
clip_232 | It's a fossa.
clip_233 | For most of the year, fossas are solitary,
clip_234 | but in the breeding season, they assemble in a way that is all their own.
clip_235 | Each mature female takes up residence in a special mating tree.
clip_236 | Half a dozen or so male fossas have gathered in the forest below it,
clip_237 | but she is clearly occupied.
clip_238 | So, one of the males leaves his scent.
clip_239 | A visiting card, just to show that he called.
clip_240 | He will just have to wait around and see whether she takes any notice.
clip_241 | Her present engagement can last all night.
clip_242 | With its top predators distracted, the rest of the forest animals
clip_243 | can go about their normal nightly business undisturbed.
clip_244 | These are immature leaf bugs, a species found only here in Madagascar.
clip_245 | Why they have this extraordinary shape, no one knows.
clip_246 | They feed on tree sap,
clip_247 | absorbing the part they need and excreting the rest as a sweet liquid
clip_248 | sometimes known, perhaps flatteringly, as honeydew.
clip_249 | And honeydew, in turn, provides food for a particular species of small lemur.
clip_250 | The gray mouse lemur is only 15 centimeters long,
clip_251 | one of the smallest primates in the world.
clip_252 | It's very active and needs an energy-packed food.
clip_253 | And while the sugar drops are clearly delicious,
clip_254 | they're not very sustaining.
clip_255 | So, she's not going to let a single drop go to waste.
clip_256 | The male fossas below are still awaiting their turn.
clip_257 | So, having eaten as much as she can,
clip_258 | she retreats to the safety of her nest hole
clip_259 | to sleep during the daylight hours.
clip_260 | Things are not looking so satisfactory on the ground
clip_261 | around the fossas' mating tree.
clip_262 | The pair above are clearly still engaged.
clip_263 | He will either have to find another mating tree or be very patient.
clip_264 | But he may well fail altogether.
clip_265 | A third of Madagascar's fossas have disappeared in the last 20 years,
clip_266 | a result of the continued destruction of their forests by people.
clip_267 | Since these pictures were recorded,
clip_268 | this forest, and the unique life it once contained,
clip_269 | have disappeared altogether.
clip_270 | Only three percent of Madagascar's dry forest remains.
clip_271 | Worldwide, we have now destroyed
clip_272 | over half of the forests that once flourished on our planet.
clip_273 | Not only are we losing the animals that once lived in them,
clip_274 | we are also changing the climate of the entire globe.
clip_275 | But our planet's forests, if given the chance,
clip_276 | are almost unbelievably resilient.
clip_277 | Perhaps the best proof we have of their ability to recover
clip_278 | can be seen on the site of one of our greatest disasters.
clip_279 | Chernobyl.
clip_280 | In 1986, one of the four reactors at the Chernobyl nuclear plant exploded.
clip_281 | It turned this utopian vision of the future into a ghost town.
clip_282 | Over 100,000 people were immediately evacuated,
clip_283 | never to return.
clip_284 | The fallout zone was declared uninhabitable for the next 20,000 years.
clip_285 | Yet despite the radiation, there has been a remarkable recovery.
clip_286 | Within only a decade,
clip_287 | vegetation began to germinate in the ruined city.
clip_288 | And as the forest reestablished itself, animals began to appear.
clip_289 | At first it was thought that these were rare visitors,
clip_290 | but it soon became clear that the former city
clip_291 | was occupied by an established and thriving wild community.
clip_292 | Within only 20 years,
clip_293 | science has recorded populations of animals
clip_294 | similar to that in the wilder parts of Europe.
clip_295 | Roe deer are now a common sight, wandering through the suburbs.
clip_296 | Herds of the endangered Przewalski's horse
clip_297 | now roam freely through the once busy city.
clip_298 | Most surprising of all perhaps,
clip_299 | the top predator of these forests has reappeared.
clip_300 | Wolves.
clip_301 | Hunters like these would only return
clip_302 | if their prey and the surrounding forest is also thriving.
clip_303 | Now, studies have shown
clip_304 | that there are seven times more wolves inside the exclusion zone than outside it.
clip_305 | No unprotected human being
clip_306 | can stay here for long without lethal risk.
clip_307 | But in driving us out,
clip_308 | the radiation has created space for wildlife to return.
clip_309 | The dramatic recolonization of Chernobyl in the space of only 30 years
clip_310 | is proof of forests' extraordinary resilience.
clip_311 | If we choose to give forests time and space,
clip_312 | they could reclothe the earth
clip_313 | with much of the rich and varied communities of animals and plants
clip_314 | of which we have, so recently, robbed it.
clip_315 | A future with more forests is key to the resilience of our planet.
