clip_1 | Just 50 years ago,
clip_2 | we finally ventured to the Moon.
clip_3 | For the very first time,
clip_4 | we looked back at our own planet.
clip_5 | Since then, the human population has more than doubled.
clip_6 | This series will celebrate the natural wonders that remain
clip_7 | and reveal what we must preserve
clip_8 | to ensure people and nature thrive.
clip_9 | Dolphins...
clip_10 | panicking.
clip_11 | They're being hunted by false killer whales.
clip_12 | Dolphins are faster in short bursts.
clip_13 | But their hunters have stamina.
clip_14 | Just as the killer whales close in,
clip_15 | the dolphins make a sudden turn to evade their predators.
clip_16 | These extraordinary events are taking place far from land,
clip_17 | where few of us ever venture.
clip_18 | This is the ocean beyond the boundary of any country...
clip_19 | largely ungoverned, wild, and lawless.
clip_20 | Nothing symbolizes our relationship with the high seas
clip_21 | better than the blue whale.
clip_22 | Weighing 200 tons and 30 meters long,
clip_23 | these are the largest animals ever to have existed.
clip_24 | Yet much of their lives is still a mystery to us.
clip_25 | Blue whales live far out to sea,
clip_26 | roaming every ocean from the tropics to the poles.
clip_27 | We have only recently discovered
clip_28 | a few special places where they come close to shore.
clip_29 | The Gulf of California,
clip_30 | on Mexico's Pacific coast.
clip_31 | This is a sanctuary for blue whales.
clip_32 | Meet the world's biggest newborn...
clip_33 | a baby blue.
clip_34 | Just a month old,
clip_35 | she's already eight meters long and weighs six tons.
clip_36 | Her mother shelters her with a protective fin.
clip_37 | They caress one another, cherishing their close bond.
clip_38 | These are the most intimate images ever captured
clip_39 | of a blue whale mother and her calf.
clip_40 | This female will give birth only once every two or three years,
clip_41 | so each baby blue is extremely precious.
clip_42 | The calf will grow three tons a month.
clip_43 | Once, there were more than 300,000 blue whales,
clip_44 | but last century, they were hunted relentlessly,
clip_45 | and only a few thousand survived.
clip_46 | Blue whales are now protected,
clip_47 | and their numbers are slowly increasing.
clip_48 | Soon, this calf will leave these sheltered waters
clip_49 | to roam the high seas.
clip_50 | We once thought that the high seas were simply too vast for us to damage,
clip_51 | but we now know that her ocean home is under threat as never before.
clip_52 | Out here in the big blue, there remain a few pristine places
clip_53 | to remind us how rich the oceans can still be.
clip_54 | Spinner dolphins.
clip_55 | In the Pacific, off the coast of Costa Rica, Central America,
clip_56 | they are starting to gather in great numbers.
clip_57 | Spinners live in pods,
clip_58 | groups of individuals linked by complex social relationships.
clip_59 | The dolphins constantly touch and talk with one another,
clip_60 | using a language of clicks and whistles.
clip_61 | They are shadowed by yellowfin tuna.
clip_62 | The tuna rely on the dolphins to find food.
clip_63 | Everyone is searching for the same prey...
clip_64 | lantern fish...
clip_65 | the most numerous fish on the planet.
clip_66 | No longer than your finger,
clip_67 | lantern fish spend most of their time hiding in the deep.
clip_68 | So, despite their astounding abundance, we don't fish for them.
clip_69 | They are one of the few fish that still thrives.
clip_70 | As they close in on their prey, the dolphin pod gets bigger and bigger.
clip_71 | This pod could be 10,000 strong.
clip_72 | For every one at the surface, 20 swim below.
clip_73 | Using echolocation, a type of sonar,
clip_74 | the dolphins detect lantern fish in the depths
clip_75 | and drive them to the surface.
clip_76 | They patrol the underside of the shoal
clip_77 | to stop their prey escaping back to the deep.
clip_78 | Once the dolphins have had their fill,
clip_79 | there's still plenty more for other predators.
clip_80 | Mobula rays swoop in.
clip_81 | To maximize their catch, the rays attack in formation.
clip_82 | A wall of mouths scooping up their prey.
clip_83 | Because we don't fish for them, lantern fish and their predators thrive.
clip_84 | All these hunters have barely made a dent in the great shoal.
clip_85 | Most life in the open ocean is concentrated in a thin surface layer,
clip_86 | where the power of the sun has its greatest effect.
clip_87 | These sunlit shallows are fertilized in a surprising way.
clip_88 | As the dolphins produce waste, they play a vital role,
clip_89 | recycling nutrients from the deep up to the surface.
clip_90 | This marine manure
clip_91 | helps to fuel the basis of all life in the open ocean.
clip_92 | Phytoplankton...
clip_93 | microscopic drifting plants.
clip_94 | They combine nutrients in seawater with energy from the sun
clip_95 | to create the very foundation of every food chain out here.
clip_96 | So all animals, from the smallest fish to the largest whale,
clip_97 | ultimately depend on these tiny plants for food.
clip_98 | And in turn, the phytoplankton benefits from the nutrients
clip_99 | produced by these animals.
clip_100 | Crucially, phytoplankton also produce half the oxygen in the air we breathe.
clip_101 | So, no matter where you live,
clip_102 | you can thank these exquisite little plants
clip_103 | for every other breath you take.
clip_104 | In ideal conditions, they can bloom to such an extent
clip_105 | that great swathes of the ocean turn green.
clip_106 | Surprisingly, phytoplankton also play a vital role in cloud formation.
clip_107 | Moisture evaporating from the ocean
clip_108 | condenses around tiny particles created by the plankton.
clip_109 | These droplets combine to grow into colossal clouds.
clip_110 | They can rise 20 kilometers into the atmosphere.
clip_111 | These oceanic clouds reflect the sun's energy back into space,
clip_112 | helping to protect the Earth from rising temperatures.
clip_113 | Not only do the oceans produce half the oxygen we breathe,
clip_114 | they also drive the weather and climate,
clip_115 | transporting life-giving fresh water around the world.
clip_116 | The high seas are the life-support system of our planet.
clip_117 | They have such power simply because they're so vast.
clip_118 | The oceans cover two-thirds of the globe, and that's just the surface.
clip_119 | They're also immensely deep.
clip_120 | We can only journey to this unexplored space
clip_121 | in special submarines that can withstand the crushing pressure.
clip_122 | The average depth of the oceans is nearly four kilometers,
clip_123 | and the deepest point more than ten.
clip_124 | The deep makes up 95 percent of all the space available for life.
clip_125 | This alien world is home to weird and mysterious creatures.
clip_126 | Few are stranger than this one.
clip_127 | For years, we only knew they existed from the occasional one washed ashore.
clip_128 | They have hardly ever been seen alive.
clip_129 | An oarfish.
clip_130 | Ten meters long.
clip_131 | Hanging vertically
clip_132 | and using rhythmic waves along their dorsal fin,
clip_133 | oarfish commute easily between the surface and the depths.
clip_134 | Below 200 meters, there's not enough light for plants to grow,
clip_135 | so deep-sea animals depend on food sinking down from the surface...
clip_136 | marine snow.
clip_137 | A crown jellyfish drifts with tentacles outstretched
clip_138 | to ensnare pray.
clip_139 | They live in every ocean, to depths of seven kilometers.
clip_140 | The deep is so vast that these could be the most abundant of all jellyfish.
clip_141 | We used to think the deep supported little life,
clip_142 | but scientists now believe
clip_143 | there are ten times more animals living here than previously thought.
clip_144 | So, there must be many yet to be discovered.
clip_145 | This deep-water crustacean, Cystisoma, is as clear as glass.
clip_146 | It hides in plain sight.
clip_147 | In this twilight zone,
clip_148 | invisibility can be the difference between finding a meal and being one.
clip_149 | Its huge eyes strain to see in the gloom.
clip_150 | No light penetrates below a thousand meters.
clip_151 | In this darkness, animals create their own light...
clip_152 | bioluminescence.
clip_153 | A glowing lure entices victims into this dragonfish's terrifying teeth.
clip_154 | On most expeditions down here, we are surprised by something new.
clip_155 | A deep-sea anglerfish.
clip_156 | Her extraordinary array of sensors
clip_157 | will detect even the faintest movement by prey tempted to her lure.
clip_158 | Here, in the deep midwater, predators play a patient game.
clip_159 | Eventually, we reach the bottom,
clip_160 | nearly a thousand meters down.
clip_161 | The deep-sea plains cover more than half the Earth's surface,
clip_162 | and yet we know more about the surface of the Moon.
clip_163 | Chimaera, an ancient relative of the shark,
clip_164 | up to two meters long.
clip_165 | Few species of this size can make a living on the barren seafloor.
clip_166 | Moving slowly to conserve energy,
clip_167 | they use special electrical sensors around their mouths
clip_168 | to search for scarce prey buried in the sediment.
clip_169 | Rocky outcrops rising from the seafloor can be oases in this desert.
clip_170 | This ragged-tooth shark has come here for good reason.
clip_171 | Five hundred meters down off the coast of Florida,
clip_172 | a rare hot spot of life.
clip_173 | Lophelia, deep-sea coral reefs.
clip_174 | We used to think that corals
clip_175 | were only found in the warm, sunny shallows.
clip_176 | But, astonishingly, deep-sea reefs cover a greater area of the seafloor
clip_177 | than their shallow-water relatives.
clip_178 | These underwater forests
clip_179 | provide shelter and food for a rich community of marine life.
clip_180 | They're also vital nurseries for many deep-sea creatures.
clip_181 | The corals are made up of many anemone-like individuals,
clip_182 | polyps that live in colonies connected by a hard skeleton.
clip_183 | The polyps have stinging cells in their tentacles
clip_184 | to snare passing prey, their only source of food.
clip_185 | But they don't always get to keep their catch.
clip_186 | A bristle worm has set up home within the coral.
clip_187 | It checks the polyps for a freshly caught morsel...
clip_188 | and steals it from the coral.
clip_189 | But this theft is actually a protection racket.
clip_190 | Urchins attack and eat the corals.
clip_191 | Time for payback.
clip_192 | The urchin may have protective spines, but the worm has a shocking weapon,
clip_193 | and goes on the attack.
clip_194 | The urchin has been seen off,
clip_195 | and the worm has saved its home.
clip_196 | Like most deep-sea animals,
clip_197 | these corals grow extremely slowly.
clip_198 | Some reefs may be 40,000 years old.
clip_199 | Despite being so far beneath the surface, these corals are still within our reach.
clip_200 | Deep-sea fishing nets dragged across the seafloor
clip_201 | reduce the fragile reefs to rubble.
clip_202 | Half of all deep-sea corals have already been destroyed.
clip_203 | It will take centuries for these communities to recover.
clip_204 | Beyond the boundary of any one country,
clip_205 | the high seas are wild and barely protected.
clip_206 | Wildest of all, the Southern Ocean,
clip_207 | home of the albatross.
clip_208 | Albatross live solitary lives far out to sea.
clip_209 | They can travel hundreds of kilometers a day,
clip_210 | often for weeks at a time, searching for food.
clip_211 | A dead sea lion is a rare opportunity.
clip_212 | Giant petrels are the first to arrive.
clip_213 | They use their powerful beaks to rip the carcass open.
clip_214 | Known as sea vultures,
clip_215 | they are the top scavenger in Antarctic waters.
clip_216 | Black-browed albatross have an extraordinary sense of smell
clip_217 | and can follow a scent from 20 kilometers away.
clip_218 | The black-browed must grab mouthfuls when they can.
clip_219 | They are bullied by the more aggressive giant petrels.
clip_220 | Wilson's petrels are too small to compete
clip_221 | and pick off scraps from the edge of the frenzy.
clip_222 | These delicate little petrels are the most numerous of all seabirds
clip_223 | because they're found in every ocean.
clip_224 | It's only when these normally solitary birds
clip_225 | gather like this
clip_226 | that we can appreciate the wealth of life supported by the high seas.
clip_227 | A wandering albatross is last to arrive.
clip_228 | It dwarfs the other birds and uses its great size
clip_229 | and three-meter wingspan to dominate.
clip_230 | Even the giant petrels back off.
clip_231 | The wanderer finally gets its share.
clip_232 | In recent years, albatross and other seabirds
clip_233 | have been in decline.
clip_234 | Their need to travel great distances exposes them
clip_235 | to the dangers of a poorly regulated and overexploited ocean.
clip_236 | It's a problem for all hunters of the high seas.
clip_237 | These giants cross entire oceans in their search for food.
clip_238 | They can grow over three meters long and weigh half a ton.
clip_239 | Bluefin tuna.
clip_240 | They're streamlined to perfection and built for speed.
clip_241 | They hunt in great packs, hundreds strong.
clip_242 | The target: a school of anchovies.
clip_243 | They gently corral the anchovies into a tight ball at the surface,
clip_244 | careful not to cause panic.
clip_245 | And then they attack.
clip_246 | This is a highly coordinated hunt.
clip_247 | The tuna take turns,
clip_248 | striking from the same direction to keep the anchovies on the run.
clip_249 | After a mouthful, each bluefin peels off to take its place at the rear.
clip_250 | Wave after wave continues the assault.
clip_251 | With their power and devastating pace,
clip_252 | bluefin tuna are one of the ocean's most impressive hunters.
clip_253 | They are also the most prized fish in the sea.
clip_254 | So valuable that a single bluefin can sell in Japan
clip_255 | for over a million dollars.
clip_256 | So, perhaps it's inevitable
clip_257 | that they have been fished almost to extinction.
clip_258 | Bluefin tuna are not the only ones in peril.
clip_259 | Decades of unsustainable fishing
clip_260 | have left many fish stocks in serious decline.
clip_261 | A third have collapsed altogether.
clip_262 | Plastic pollution is a grave issue for our oceans,
clip_263 | but industrial overfishing is far more dangerous.
clip_264 | If we continue to harvest the seas in this way,
clip_265 | it's not just fisheries that will collapse.
clip_266 | The whole ocean system could follow.
clip_267 | One hundred million sharks are killed every year,
clip_268 | just to make shark fin soup.
clip_269 | Ninety percent of all large ocean hunters have disappeared.
clip_270 | Without them at the top of the food chain, the whole community of marine life
clip_271 | is declining and changing beyond recognition.
clip_272 | Squid are increasingly replacing fish.
clip_273 | We have severely depleted both their predators and competitors,
clip_274 | so squid are taking over,
clip_275 | an indication of a serious imbalance in the oceans.
clip_276 | Squid breed quickly and have lots of fast-growing young,
clip_277 | so they can rapidly exploit the gaps left by the fish that we have harvested.
clip_278 | They lay their eggs in cases on the seafloor.
clip_279 | The young develop even faster in these warm, shallow waters.
clip_280 | With such drastic changes in the marine menu,
clip_281 | predators are having to adapt.
clip_282 | Sea lions prefer to eat more energy-rich prey,
clip_283 | like anchovies and sardines,
clip_284 | but with these in short supply,
clip_285 | they're forced to rely more on a diet of squid.
clip_286 | We, too, will be forced to change the seafood we eat
clip_287 | if we continue to fish as we do.
clip_288 | But if we harvest the oceans in a sustainable way,
clip_289 | they can be marvelously productive
clip_290 | and will provide us with an abundance of food.
clip_291 | There are already signs that the ocean has the power
clip_292 | to recover astonishingly quickly.
clip_293 | Humpback whales.
clip_294 | They live in every ocean,
clip_295 | traveling the high seas, from their polar feeding grounds
clip_296 | to the tropics, where they breed.
clip_297 | Yet whales have not always enjoyed such freedom.
clip_298 | Once, there were more than a hundred thousand humpbacks
clip_299 | in the oceans,
clip_300 | but last century, they were hunted to near extinction.
clip_301 | Just a few thousand survived the onslaught.
clip_302 | A huge public outcry
clip_303 | finally led to a ban on commercial whaling in 1986.
clip_304 | Since then, the number of humpback whales has been steadily increasing.
clip_305 | They're returning to their ancestral feeding grounds,
clip_306 | like these off the coast of South Africa.
clip_307 | They are gathering to take advantage of a seasonal abundance of krill,
clip_308 | tiny shrimp-like crustaceans.
clip_309 | The whales take in great mouthfuls of water,
clip_310 | trapping the krill on sieves of hairy bristles
clip_311 | that line their jaws.
clip_312 | Each whale can eat over a ton a day.
clip_313 | With food so plentiful, fur seals come to claim their share.
clip_314 | These extraordinary scenes were unimaginable just a few years ago.
clip_315 | They form super-groups, hundreds strong.
clip_316 | This is the greatest gathering of whales seen for a century.
clip_317 | Whales recycle nutrients that enrich surface waters,
clip_318 | which fuel the growth of phytoplankton,
clip_319 | and they, in turn, feed krill in a perfect self-sustaining cycle.
clip_320 | We now know that a healthy community of great hunters,
clip_321 | whales, dolphins, tuna, and sharks,
clip_322 | is essential for a fully-functioning ocean.
clip_323 | And a functioning ocean is vital to the health of our planet
clip_324 | and humanity.
clip_325 | In a remarkable recovery,
clip_326 | humpback whales have almost returned to their original numbers.
clip_327 | But during that time,
clip_328 | we have done more harm to the oceans than ever before in human history.
clip_329 | Only with global cooperation
clip_330 | will our oceans recover and thrive once again.
clip_331 | We saved the whales by international agreement.
clip_332 | Now, it is time to save our oceans.
clip_333 | Please visit ourplanet.com to discover what we need to do now
clip_334 | to protect the high seas.
